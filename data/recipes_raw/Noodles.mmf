      Title: MONGOLIAN HOT POT
 Categories: Oriental, Main dish

      3 lb Boneless lean lamb
      4 oz Bean thread noodles
    1/2 lb Spinach
    1/2 lb Chinese cabbage
      1 qt Chicken stock
      1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
      2 tb Finely chopped scallions
      1 ts Minced garlic
      1 tb Finely chopped cilantro

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
      2 tb Sesame paste
           -=OR=- peanut butter
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
      2 ts Chili bean sauce
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Hot water
 
  USING A CLEAVER or sharp knife, slice the lamb into very thin slices. Soak
  the noodles in warm water for 5 minutes, then drain them and cut them into
  5-inch lengths. Separate the spinach leaves from the stalks and wash them
  well. Discard the stalks. Cut the Chinese cabbage into 3-inch pieces.
  Combine all the ingredients for the dipping sauce in a small bowl and mix
  them well. Each guest should have his or her own small portion of dipping
  sauce and a plate containing lamb, spinach and Chinese cabbage. When you
  are ready to begin, bring the stock to a boil and light the fondue. Ladle
  the stock into the fondue pot and put the ginger, scallions, garlic and
  coriander into the stock. Each person selects a piece of food and cooks it

  the noodles to the pot, let them heat through, then ladle the soup into
  soup bowls. This dish also works successfully with other foods such as
  steak, fish balls, oysters, shrimp, squid, mushrooms and lettuce, although
  it will no longer be a Mongolian Hot Pot, but more like the Cantonese
  Chrysanthemum Pot.

 Categories: Oriental, Pasta
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh thin noodles
           Peanut oil
    2/3 c  Chicken broth

---------------------------PORK & VEGETABLE SAUCE---------------------------
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 lb Bok choy
           - cut into 2-in sections
    1/2 lb Barbecued pork strips
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
      1 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
           -=OR=- dry sherry
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in
      2 tb Cold chicken broth
 
  BLANCH 1 POUND FRESH noodles in boiling water to wash away the starch and
  to loosen them up (about 2 minutes). Drain them well. Scatter the noodles
  in a baking pan. Use a pair of chopsticks and your hands to untangle them
  as much as possible. Put a layer of the noodles 1-inch deep in each of 2
  large, heavy skillets. Pour 2 tablespoons of oil and 1/3 cup chicken broth
  in each. Cook over a low flame until the broth boils away and the bottom
  becomes brown and crisp. From time to time, add a little oil and broth to
  keep the noodles moist and allow the crust to develop slowly. This should
  take about 10-to-12 minutes. To flip, first shake the pan to make sure the
  cake is not stuck to the bottom (if it is, dribble some oil around the edge
  to loosen it). Cover the pan with a wide lid. Flip the skillet over,
  holding the lid firmly. The cake will drop onto the lid. Slide the cake
  back into the pan to brown it on the other side. Add more oil around the
  edge if it seems to be sticking. To serve, slide it out onto a plate and
  use it as a base for any dish with sauce.
  
  TO MAKE THE PORK AND VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the peanut oil in a wok. When it
  is hot, add the bok choy and stir-fry to coat with oil. Add the pieces of
  pork and stir-fry to heat through. Add the broth. Stir in the soy sauce,
  rice wine or sherry, and oyster sauce. When the sauce is hot, thicken it
  with the dissolved cornstarch and serve on the bed of pan-fried noodles.

      1    Sandy clay pot casserole
           -(2 quart size)
           -=OR=- Dutch oven
 
  Golden Mountain Sauce is prepared with Thai style-soy sauce, which may be
  found in Southeast Asian markets.
  
  IN A BOWL, COVER MUNG BEAN noodles with warm water; soak until soft and
  pliable, about 10 minutes. Drain. Set aside. Clean and prepare the live
  crab according to the following instructions (if using cooked crab, follow
  the instructions after the steaming step). Shell and devein the shrimp; pat
  dry. Clean squid according to the instructions below. Cut the body
  crosswise into 1-inch rings; set aside the rings and cleaned tentacles. In
  a mortar or spice mill, pound or grind the peppercorns, coriander root and
  garlic into a paste. In a bowl, mix together the sugar, Golden Mountain
  Sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice wine and sesame oil. Add oil to clay
  pot or Dutch oven. Set over medium heat. Add reserved
  coriander-garlic-pepper paste to the oil; saute lightly. Increase to high
  heat. Add ginger, chiles and the crab pieces (add cooked crab later); toss
  and brown for a minute. Add shrimp and green onions to crab mixture;
  stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce mixture and mung bean
  noodles; toss and mix together. Stir in water, cover pot, reduce to medium
  heat and simmer for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. If noodles seem dry,
  add more water. Increase to medium-high heat, add fish, squid and cooked
  crab, mix with the noodles, top with the basil leaves. Cover. Cook 3 to 5
  minutes longer. Check for doneness. Bring the clay pot to the table and
  serve hot with rice and vegetables.
  
  TO CLEAN AND PREPARE THE CRAB: Scrub the underside and in between claws and
  legs to loosen sand and grit. Rinse well with cold water. Plunge crab into
  boiling water for a minute to kill it immediately. Remove and cool. To
  disjoint and crack the crab, hold shell portion of the crab in one hand.
  With the other hand, gather the legs and claws on one side and gently pull
  and tug until the body and legs loosen and free themselves as a whole
  section from the shell. On both sides of the body are featherly gills. Pull
  off and discard these gills. The tail piece, a triangular flap, is located
  on the underside of the body. With tip of knife lift up the flap, grasp it,
  twist off and discard. Scrub exposed area clean. Now remove the legs and
  claws by gently pulling and bending them backward against their natural
  bend, and twist to free them. You now have the chest-body section where the
  tomalley liver is embedded in the cavity. Spoon it out and reserve it for
  those who appreciate it. The chest body should be chopped in half down the
  middle with a heavy cleaver. Chop each section crosswise into 3 equal
  pieces. With a light hammer or metal nut cracker, crack the mid section and
  joint of each leg and claw; set aside the pieces. (When eating, use the tip
  of the leg as a pick to dig out the meat.)
  
  TO CLEAN AND PREPARE SQUID: Grasp the body of the squid with one hand and
  with the other pull the head and tentacles away until separated from the
  body. With your finger dip into the body to remove the quill, the
  transparent cartilage and discard. Peel off the dotted skin from the body
  and discard. Rinse body with cold water. Cut between the eye and the
  tentacles; discard the head. Squeeze the thick center part of the tentacles
  to dislodge the hard beak. Rinse with cold water; set aside.

  chop and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the pork, garlic, fish sauce
  and ground pepper. Mix in crab meat, tree-ear mushrooms, carrots, bean
  sprouts, shallots and bean thread noodles; set aside. Combine the warm
  water and sugar in a bowl. Lay 1 rice paper wrapper on a damp towel. (Keep
  unused wrappers in their package.) Generously brush it with the sugar
  water; allow it to soften to a very pliable wrapper, about 30 seconds or
  sometime longer (depending upon the brand). With your hands shape 3
  tablespoons filling into a tight compact 1-inch-wide-by-4-to-5-inch-long
  cylinder. Place cylinder along the lower edge of wrapper. Roll the bottom
  up and over the roll tightly. Fold both outside edges inward to enclose the
  ends. Continue rolling up into a cylinder; set aside covered with plastic
  wrap. Repeat until all the rolls are done. To cook and brown evenly, the
  roll must be firm and evenly packed. If the wrapper has a tear, bandage it
  with a softened rice-paper remnant. In a preheated wok or saucepan, add oil
  to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 325F. Add a few rolls at a time, but do
  not crowd. Fry for 10 seconds. Immediately increase to high heat or 375F.
  Fry, turning occasionally until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove
  and drain on paper towel. Cut crosswise into 1+1/2-inch pieces. Arrange
  rolls on a plate lined with lettuce. On another plate, arrange leaves of
  lettuce, fresh coriander and mint leaves. To eat, wrap spring-roll garnish
  with sprig of coriander and mint leaves in a lettuce leaf and dip into nuoc
  cham sauce (See RECIPE).

      Title: MEE KROB
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    2-in piece of tamarind pulp
           Peanut or corn oil
           -(for deep-frying)
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles
      6 oz Med shrimp
           - shelled and deveined
      1    Whole boned chicken breast
           - cut into slices
      4    Shallots; minced
      1 tb Minced garlic
      2 sm Serrano chiles
           - finely minced
      1    Lime (zest only)
  3 1/2 tb Tomato paste
      4 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
      3 tb Fresh lime juice
      4    Green onions; trimmed,
           - cut into 1-in lengths
           - blanched
      3 tb Fresh coriander leaves
    1/2 lb Bean sprouts; tails removed
           - (for garnish)

------------------------------CRISPY EGG LACE------------------------------
           Oil for deep-frying
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  COVER TAMARIND WITH 3/4 CUP hot water. Crush and break up pulp with a fork
  and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer and press
  it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into a wok or deep
  saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to 375F. In a large paper
  bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small batches. Add 1 batch to the
  oil. If the temperature is correct, noodles should puff up within seconds.
  Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat
  with remaining noodles. If you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it
  at this time (See below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are
  done, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil
  over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1
  minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove and
  set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime zest to
  the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1 minute). Add
  tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar becomes a
  dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should pull away from the
  wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the caramelized state (about 3
  to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the mixture. Immediately add the
  reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce, reduce to low heat and simmer
  together for 1 minute. Add lime juice, reserved chicken-shrimp mixture,
  green onion and remaining lime zest; toss just enough to heat through.
  Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently
  crush noodles and toss with sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of
  noodles. Add last third of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat.
  Toss in the coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace
  (broken into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts.
  
  CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok. Keep
  oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a
  medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through. Let
  eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds or until
  lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have an irregular
  lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a warm oven. Break
  into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces. ---

      Title: CLASSIC SPINACH LASAGNA
 Categories: Main dish, Pasta
      Yield: 8 servings
 
-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 oz Pancetta; chopped
           - (or blanched bacon)
      3 tb Chopped onion
    1/2 lb Ground round of beef
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 oz Chicken livers
           - cleaned and minced
      2 tb Tomato paste

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Fresh spinach; -=OR=-
      2 pk -Frozen Spinach
           Salt
      1 c  Ricotta
      1    Egg
           Whole nutmeg
      1 lb Freshly made lasagna noodles
  1 1/2 tb Butter
      1 c  Freshly grated parmigiano
 
  TO MAKE THE MEAT SAUCE: Put the dried mushrooms in a bowl and pour 1 cup
  boiling water over them. Let them sit for 30 minutes, then drain, reserving
  the water. Rinse the mushroom pieces thoroughly, chop them fine, and rinse
  again to remove all traces of grit. Line a sieve with a dampened paper
  towel and strain the mushroom-soaking liquid into a small bowl. Heat the
  olive oil in a large non-reactive skillet. Add the pancetta and onion and
  saute over low heat 5 minutes. Raise heat to medium, crumble in the ground
  beef, and add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several grindings of fresh pepper.
  Saute 5 more minutes, stirring to break up the meat. Add the chopped
  chicken livers and the chopped porcini. In a measuring cup, combine 1/2 cup
  of the mushroom-soaking liquid and 1/2 cup hot water. Dissolve the tomato
  paste in this liquid and add it to the skillet. Bring to a simmer, cover
  the pan and cook 1 hour, stirring occasionally and regulating the heat to
  maintain a gentle simmer. TO MAKE THE SPINACH FILLING: If you are using
  fresh spinach, wash it carefully, and place it in a large pot with only the
  amount of water that clings to the leaves. Sprinkle lightly with salt,
  cover the pot and turn heat to high. As soon as the spinach wilts, reduce
  heat to medium and cook 5 minutes. (If using frozen spinach, cook according
  to package directions.) Drain the spinach in a colander, spray with cold
  water, squeeze out most of the water, and chop it fine. Put it into a bowl
  and add the ricotta, the egg, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several gratings of
  fresh nutmeg. Stir all together well. COOKING THE LASAGNA: Bring a large
  pot of salted water to the boil. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Lay out
  several clean dish towels on a work surface. Drop the lasagna noodles a few
  at a time into the boiling water and cook 1 minute. Drain them with a
  slotted spoon, dip them into the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, and
  lay them out on the dish towels while you cook the rest. ASSEMBLY AND
  BAKING: Preheat oven to 400F. Butter a 10-by-14-inch baking dish with 1/2
  tablespoon butter. Cover the bottom of the dish with a layer of lasagna
  noodles. (Use about a quarter of them.) Spread 1/4 of the spinach-ricotta
  mixture over the surface. Sprinkle on 1/4 of the parmigiano, then 1/4 of
  the meat sauce. Make 3 more layers in the same way, ending with the cheese
  and meat sauce. Finally, dot the top with the remaining tablespoon of
  butter. Bake 15 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling hot. Remove from
  the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.

           Coconut; (tapeworms)
           Chocolate chips
           Butterscotch chips
           Peanut butter chips
           Spagetti or ramen noodles
           - cooked - (roundworms)
           Corn
           Peanuts
           "puffy pastel things"; *
           -find at Chinese restaurants
 
  *NOTE: "puffy pastel things are to look like the cat ate styrofoam
  packing pellets-i haven't tried this
  TO MAKE:
  icrowave the honey till it bubbles(about 1 minute). add the butter,(i've
  been told using lard makes for a more realistic texture and softer
  cookie) and the molasses, if any.  add the egg, mix well, then mix in all
  the other stuff. add mix-ins of your choice to some or all of the batter.
  Chill 1 hour in the freezer or several hours in the fridge. roll dough
  logs of random length and the diameter of cat poops. roll logs in grape-
  nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done(maybe 10 to 15 minutes but with
  my flaky oven you never know).
  Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of grapenuts, with a cat
  litter scoop.  i hear you get lovely effects by decorating the box and
  scoop with melted chocolate or pudding.  i imagine brown sugar might
  work as a substitute for the new clumping litters, but i havent tried it.
  this recipe worked especially well at the halloween party where the table
  was already decorated with plastic flies.

      Title: BARB'S POTATO SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 servings
 
----------------------------------BARB DAY----------------------------------
      4 sl Bacon; diced
      1 lg Onion; diced (See note)
      2 tb Butter
  1 1/2 c  Cabbage; chopped
     12 oz Chicken broth
      3 lg Potatoes; peeled, diced
           -Salt and pepper to taste
      1 c  Egg noodles
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Butter
 
   Note: I like to prepare onion by placing it in a covered vessel and
  placing it in the microwave on high, (skin on) for about 5 minutes.
  When the onion is done, the skin can be slipped off easily, and the
  onion  chopped.  This is equivalent to sauteeing to the point where
  the onion is translucent, but for this dish the onion still needs to
  be sauteed. Using  this method cuts out the tears and most of the
  odor, not to mention, no use of fat!
  Cook the bacon in the butter until it is lightly browned, then add
  the onion and cook for a few minutes, until the onion just begins to
  brown. Add the cabbage, and cook until it is very limp. Now add the
  diced potatoes, and chicken stock.  Salt and pepper to taste.
   Cover and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender. Add the
  noodles on top of the mixture, and cover again. Cook for about 6 to
  eight minutes, or until the noodles are almost done.
    Add the milk and cream, and the 2 tablespoons of butter, and correct
  seasonings. Stir and cover the pan again. Cook over low heat just
  until warmed through.
    Serving Note:  You might like a little crisp fried, crumbled bacon
  and/or chopped chives or green onion tops as a tasty garnish.

  bird shaped nests. Before the mixture has time to harden, place the jelly
  beans or small candy easter eggs in the bowl of the nest. They will stay
  put when mixture cools. Easy and fun to make.Use your imagination as to
  items you could place in the nests.

      Title: NO FAIL LASAGNA
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    500 g  Oven Ready Lasagna Noodles
      4 tb Butter
      1 sm Onion diced
      3 tb Flour
      2 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Parmesan cheese
    3/4 ts Salt
      2    Egg yolks
      1 lb Lean ground beef
      6 c  Spagetti sauce
      8 oz Mozzerella cheese
      8 oz Ricotta OR cottage
 
  Prepare covering sauce using butter, flour and milk. Easy microwave
  method is to first melt butter, add diced onion and microwave on HI for
  1 min. Stir in flour and add milk. Microwave at HI until mixture starts
  to boil and thicken. Stir occasionally to prevent lumping.
  Otherwise, use basic white sauce technique and saute onions in fry pan,
  adding later.
  Add parmesan cheese and salt and stir.
  In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks slightly and add a small amount of
  the sauce to the eggs. Stir and then pour into the sauce, stirring
  constantly. Set aside.
  Brown the ground beef until cooked and drain off the fat.  Add to
  sauce (any prepared sauce is fine, slightly spiced works best) and set
  aside.
  NOTE: Any homemade spagetti sauce works here, and if it contains ground
  beef then omit the above addition of meat.
  Slice the mozzarella cheese.
  Grease a 9"x13"x2"deep pan.
  Add a layer of spagetti sauce on the bottom.
  Add a single layer of noodles.
  Add a layer of mozzerella, and a layer of ricotta (or cottage cheese).
  Repeat layers until all ingredients are used up, retaining enough
  noodles to top it off.
  Pour (white/cheese) sauce over the lasagna and spread it evenly.
  Sprinkle some parmesan cheese over the top.
  Bake at 325F for 25 minutes.  Broil to brown the top.  Let stand for 10
  minutes before serving.
  Serve with French bread and garlic butter.

  ingredients, except cheese in slow cooker.  Cover and cook on low setting
  8 hours, or until noodles are tender.  Top with cheese, cover and cook
  until cheese melts.
  "This is the kind of recipe that can be varied as long as the soup is
  included and enough other liquid is added.  It can be jazzed up with other
  veggies, and red and green pepper add color.  For a Tex-Mex version, add
  canned chopped chiles and chopped black olives, chili powder and cumin.
  Although the cheese can be left off, it tastes better with it."

      Title: PAD THAI.
 Categories: Main dish, Thai
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried Rice Noodles (1/8" w).
    1/2 lb Shrimp, chicken, or pork. *
    1/4 c  Fish Sauce.
      6 tb Sugar.
      6 tb White Vinegar.
      1 tb Tomato Paste.
      4    Scallions.
    1/2 c  Vegetable Oil (Approx.).
      2    Cloves Garlic, chopped fine
      2    Eggs.
    1/4 lb Bean Sprouts.
      2 tb Ground Roasted Chilies.
    1/4 c  Ground Roasted Peanuts.
           Lime Wedges.
 
  * The meat used may be either fresh shrimps, chicken, pork, or
  combinations.  The traditional uses dried shrimps and hard tofu pieces
  rather than fresh meat.
  
  Soak the noodles for 20 to 25 minutes in enough warm water to cover. They
  should be soft, but not so soft that they can be mashed easily with the
  fingers.  Later cooking will soften them more.  Drain the noodles
  thoroughly
  in a colander while preparing the other ingredients. Traditionally, they
  are
  left in full length strands, but you may cut them into shorter lengths
  (about
  8-9 inches, say) to facilitate easier stir frying.
  Peel and devein the shrimps, leaving the tails intact, OR slice the
  chicken/pork across the grain into strips not more than 1/8 inch thick and
  1-2 inches long.
  Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and tomato paste in a bowl.  Stir until
  the sugar is dissolved.  Set the mixture aside.  Slice the scallions, both
  white and green parts, diagonally into pieces 1-1/2 inches long.  Set
  aside.
  Heat a wok, and add the vegetable oil to the hot wok.  Swirl the oil to
  coat
  the surface of the wok.  Add garlic and fry till golden.  Add shrimp and
  fry
  till they turn pink, or if chicken/pork is used, fry till the pink color
  disappears completely.  Add the noodles and toss lightly to coat them with
  oil and to distribute the garlic and meat.
  Add the liquid mixed earlier and bring to a boil rapidly, gently folding
  the
  noodle, being careful not to break them.  Reduce the heat to medium and
  boil
  the mixture, folding frequently, until the noodles have absorbed the
  liquid.
  Using a wok scoop, or a stiff spatula, lift the noodles gently from one
  side
  of the wok.  Pour a little oil along the side of the wok, then break one
  egg
  and slip it into the oil.  Break the yolk, and cover the egg with the
  noodles
  immediately.  Repeat this on the opposite side of the wok with the
  remaining
  egg.  Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed, over moderate heat, until they
  are
  set and almost dry.  Additional oil may be added if the eggs or the noodles
  begin to stick to the wok.
  When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently but rapidly into the
  noodles.  Try not to break the noodles, which will be soft and fragile at
  this point.  An effective way is to insert the scoop under the eggs, lift
  it
  through, and fold the mixture over.  Continue the lifting and folding
  motion
  until the eggs are broken up and well distributed.
  Add the bean sprouts and sliced scallions, and toss the mixture quickly and
  gently, still avoiding breaking the noodles.  Cook for about 2 minutes, or
  until the bean sprouts and scallions are crisp-tender.
  Place the mixture on a large, warm serving platter.  Sprinkle ground
  chilies
  and peanuts over the top, and squeeze lime juice over that. Alternately,
  these garnishes may be served on the side for each diner to add according
  to
  tastes.
  NOTES: 1. Pad Thai is traditionally served accompanied with fresh
  vegetables,
  in particular whole scallion, a small pile of fresh raw bean sprouts (to be
  mixed into the noodles), and if available, a wedge of banana blossom.
  2. For the traditional recipe, omit the shrimps, pork/chicken, and all
  references to them.  Substitute 1/2 pound very firm tofu and 1/4 pound
  dried
  shrimps.  Put the tofu on a triple layers of paper towels, cover it with
  another triple layer, put a plate on top of that, and put a two pound
  weight
  (cans of vegetables for an example) on top of the plate.  Let stand for 20
  to
  30 minutes to press out the excess water.  Put the dried shrimp in a sieve,
  rinse them quickly under hot running water, and set aside to drain.  After
  the tofu has been pressed, slice it into strips about 1/4 inch thick, 1/2
  inch wide and 1 inch long.

  if meat mixture is too dry.  There should be plenty of sauce.  Heat
  through but do not boil.  Serve with steamed (diced or sliced) red
  potatoes, spaetzle or noodles (tossed in a small amount of melted butter
  to moisten).  Garnish with dill, parsley, and reserved bacon, broken into
  pieces.

      1 ds Black pepper
     10    Dried rice papers
           - (banh trang)
      2 c  Peanut oil
 
  ~- Combine all ingredients except rice papers and oil.  Cut the
  rice papers into quarters.  Wet the surface of each paper with water
  (use your fingers or a brush) and within about 1 min the paper will
  become flexible enough to be filled.  Place about 1 tbsp of the
  filling on each paper and roll.  Heat the oil in a wok to about
  350 deg. F.  Place rolls, flaps-down, into oil and cook 20 min
  (10 min each side), until completely done.
   Serve with Buddhist Nuoc Leo.
  ~- Disclaimer: This recipe is fat-city.  There is another form
  of spring roll skin which is inherently sticky and stretchy
  (white and barely opaque), and doesn't require deep frying.
  (One could lighly saute the carrots and potatoes beforehand.)
  I can't remember what this wrapper is called.  BTW - With this
  alternate type of "spring roll" fresh chinese parsley or cilantro is
  often included.
  ~- Side note: About forming a spring roll from quartered rice paper...

      Title: PEKING STYLE NOODLES WITH BEAN SAUCE AND MIXED GARNISH
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Chinese
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      8 oz Noodles
           -- (3-4 cups after cooking)
      6 oz Plain pressed tofu
    1/2 c  Green soybeans
           -- (frozen or fresh)  -OR-
      2 oz -Baby corn spears
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoot, diced finely
      2 oz Cucumber
      1 ts Garlic, minced
      3 tb Chinese bean sauce; -OR-
      4 tb -Dark miso
      3 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
  2 1/2 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in...
      3 tb Water
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  If you are cooking the noodles first, drain them, remove to a bowl or
  serving platter, and toss with 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to prevent
  sticking (do not rinse in cold water as this reduces flavor).
  Crumble the pressed tofu coarsely to yield 1-1/2 cups.
  Parboil green soybeans till almost tender yet still firm (10 minutes
  for frozen).  If using fresh baby corn spears, steam or parboil till
  tender; if canned, rinse with boiling water.  Rinse green soybeans or
  corn in cold water and chop finely.  You should have about 1/2 cup
  baby corn.
  It is not necessary to peel or seed the hothouse (English) or Oriental
  cucumber.  Regular cucumber should be pared and seeded, but leave a
  few narrow strips of skin for color and texture.  Julienne finely to
  yield 1/2 cup.
  If you are using miso, dissolve it in 1/4 cup warm water.
  Put 3 tablespoons oil into a preheated pan over high.  When the oil is
  hot, reduce heat to medium-high.  Add garlic and stir-fry a few
  seconds to release aroma.  Add pressed tofu and bean sauce or miso.
  Stir-fry briefly to mix.  Add 1-1/2 cups water, 1 tablepsoon soy
  sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until
  the boil is reached.  Gradually stir in cornstarch mixture and cook,
  stirring, another minute or so until the consistency is like a light
  gravy, not too thick.  Test for salt, and add an extra tablespoon soy
  sauce if needed.  (at this point, if you like, you can heat noodles
  and/or green soybeans, baby corn, and bamboo shoot by combining with
  the sauce until just mixed.)  Add 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. Remove
  from the stove.  Pour sauce over noodles, and top with garnish in
  separate arrangement (garnish with just the cucumber if you have
  added soybeans or baby corn and bamboo shoot to the sauce).  Toss
  before serving.

      Title: KOUSHARI (LENTILS, MACARONI AND RICE IN OIL)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Ads iswid (brown lentils)
           Water
           Salt
      1 c  Small macaroni noodles
      1 c  Short grain rice
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Tomato puree

---------------------------------TA'LEYA II---------------------------------
      2 lg Onions
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1    Garlic clove (or more)
           -- finely chopped
 
  This is classed as an 'oil' dish by Coptic Egyptians and is prepared during
  periods of fasting when animal products cannot be taken.  You may cook the
  lentils, macaroni and rice simultaneously in 3 pots, or if, like me, you
  like to keep pots to a minimum, use the method given.  This is the way they
  prepare it in Egypt anyway.
  
  Place lentils in a sieve and wash well under running water.  Place in a
  large pot and add 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt.  Bring to the boil,
  then simmer for 1 hour until tender but still intact.  Drain and keep
  aside.
  
  Clean same pot and add 4 cups water.  Bring to the boil, add 2 teaspoons
  salt and the macaroni.  Stir constantly until water returns to the boil and
  cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes until tender.  Stir occasionally. Drain and
  keep aside.  Clean pot again and dry.
  
  Wash rice well in sieve under running water and drain.  Heat oil in pot and
  fry rice over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.  Add 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon
  salt and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.  Cover and simmer over
  low heat for 15 minutes or until tender.  Leave covered off the heat for 5
  minutes for grains to separate.
  
  Prepare the ta'leya (directions below), add tomato puree and bring to the
  boil.
  
  Add lentils and macaroni to cooked rice and toss together lightly with a
  fork.  Pour hot ta'leya and tomato mixture on top, toss again and cover
  pot.  Leave over low heat for 10 minutes.  Serve hot.
  
  TA'LEYA: Halve peeled onions lengthwise then slice thinly to give
  semicircles.  Heat olive oil in a pan, add onions and fry over medium heat
  until golden brown.  Add garlic and cook a minute longer.

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Casseroles
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      9    Lasagne noodles
           -(OR as much as needed)
      1 lb Tofu
    1/2 c  Tomato paste (or sauce)
      1    -to:
      2 c  Tomato sauce
           -(as much as desired)
      1 bn Chard (or spinach)
      3 tb Nutritional yeast
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Basil
      3 tb Canola oil
      3 sm Onions; -OR-
      1 lb Mushrooms
      3    Celery stalks
  1 1/2 c  Cauliflower
 
  Mash up the tofu in a bowl and add salt, nutritional yeast, spices, tomato
  paste.  Chop the celery, caulflower, and onion finely and saute in oil.
  When mostly cooked add the mushrooms, sliced. When the mushrooms are done,
  add the vegetables to the tofu and mix well.
  
  Cook the lasagne noodles in water until done.  This can be done beforehand
  to save time.  Grease your casserole pan lightly with some oil to help
  prevent sticking. Place a layer of noodles down and spoon some tomato sauce
  over it.  Put a layer of tofu/veggies down.
  
  Saute the chard (or spinach) in a pan with just a little bit of oil. When
  completely cooked down and soft, add half to the lasagne, spreading evenly
  over the layer. Add more sauce then noodles, then tofu than another layer
  of chard.  Top with more sauce, more noodles and a large amount of sauce
  (to prevent any burning or drying out of the noodles when they're cooked).
  Preheat oven to about 350 or 375 and cook roughly 35 minutes, or until
  bubbly and hot.  SERVE! I guarantee it'll be among the best lasagne you've
  ever had....

           Parsley, fresh;chopped
 
  The combination of cabbage & noodles pleases the palate. In preparing this
  dish, I recommend sauteeing the cabbage & onions, separately. This method
  brings out the flavor of each food.
  
  Saute the cabbage in 1 tbsp of corn oil about 15 minutes. Set aside. In a
  separate pan, saute onions and garlic, along with the salt, pepper and
  paprika in the remaining corn oil. Cook until the onions are translucent .
  Stir the onions and cabbage together. Add the cooked noodles and reheat.
  Serve hot, garnished with parsley.

      1 tb Coconut, flaked
 
  Shred chicken.  Stir together water, garlic, curry, and lime juice. Bring
  to boil, then stir in noodles and green beans. Continue boiling over medium
  heat, stirring occasionally, 7 minutes or until noodles are tender. Stir in
  chicken and coconut; heat through.
  
  Sylvia's comments: In spite of its name, this was more flavorful than
  spicy.  For a more fiery effect, use more curry powder.

  ORIGINAL POSTERS NOTES: *NOTE: For greater flavor with little or no fat
  add, substitute no fat beef broth or some wine for part of the water called
  for in the ingredients.
  
  **If you have a sensitivity to sodium, note that the dry onion soup mix may
  be high in salt.  I have also posted a recipe for onion seasoning mix in
  CAT 3 TOPic 31 that was posted on the board sometime back that enables you
  to use your own mix and control the amount of salt in it.

      If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper
  half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you are using
  dried lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain and finely chop.
  
      In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots,
  garlic, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of the fish
  sauce. Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the frogs' legs.
  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
      Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 2-inch sections.
  
      Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute
  until translucent. Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all sides, about 3
  minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover
  and simmer for 15 minutes.
  
      Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1
  tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish sauce. Cook,
  stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.
  
      Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil.
   Remove from the heat.
  
      Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.
  
      Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles.
  
      Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush it
  and cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor. Remove the stalk before
  serving.

  Soak rice noodles in warm water to cover for 15 to 20 minutes. Prepare all
  the remaining ingredients and place them next to the stove, along with a
  small serving platter. When the noodles are very limp and white, drain and
  measure 2-1/2 cups. Set by the stove as well. The idea is to keep
  everything warm. Heat Wok or large skillet at medium-hi heat and add 1 tbs
  oil and swirl to coat the surface. When oil if very hot drop in garlic and
  toss until golden, about 30 seconds. Add shrimp and toss until they turn
  pink, for beef or pork until light brown, no more that 1 min. for shrimp.
  Remove from pan and set aside. Add the egg to pan and tilt the pan to
  spread it into a thin sheet. As soon as it begins to set, scramble it to
  break it into small lumps. Remove and set aside with shrimp. Heat 1 tbs of
  oil in wok or skillet and heat 30 seconds and add soften noodles. Thin
  noodles to cover the surface of the pan, then clump them together and
  gently turn over. repeat this process until the noodles soften and curl
  into ivory ringlets. Add fish sauce and turn noodles to evenly season. Add
  sugar and peanuts and continue to turn the noodles to season. Reserve some
  of the bean sprouts, green onion for garnish. Add the bean sprouts, green
  onions and the shrimp and egg mixture. Cook for 1 minute, turning often.
  Transfer noodles to the serving paltter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime
  wedges over the top. Garnish with remaining beansprouts and lime and serve
  at once. Serves 1 very hungry, or 2 appetizers.

  A national noodle dish of Thailand. It is now served in many trendy
  restaurants. It is a personal dish - you can add ingredients that you
  like, and make it as spicy or tart as you wish. Can be used as a basis for
  a stir fry of leftovers. Rice noodles are available at most ethnic Asian
  and gourmet stores.
  
  Soak noodles in warm water for 20 minutes, drain and reserve.
  
  Combine fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, ketchup and chili flakes. Reserve
  
  Heat a wok or large skillet on high heat and add oil. Stir in garlic, cook
  10 seconds, then add shrimp and chicken.
  
  Stir fry until all ingredients are cooked, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add eggs
  and toss together until scrambled.
  
  Add noodles to the wok. Mix well to combine all ingredients. Pour in
  reserved sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, until noodles are soft and
  tender. If they appear dry, add up to 1/4 cup water.

      Title: CLAY POT SHRIMP WITH BEAN THREAD NOODLES - GOONG OPE MAW DIN
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Pasta
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Bean Thread Noodles
      2 tb Vegetable Oil
    1/4 c  Cilantro Pesto (See Recipe)
      1 tb Fresh Ginger, Finely Chopped
      1 lb Shrimp, Peeled & Deveined
    1/3 c  Coarsely Chopped Green Onion
    1/4 c  Chicken Stock
      2 tb Fish Sauce (Nam Pla)
      1 tb Oyster Sauce
      1 tb Chinese Rice Wine Or:
           Dry Sherry
      1 ts Dark Soy Sauce
      1 ts Asian Sesame Oil
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
           Handful Of Cilantro Leaves

-------------------------------CILANTRO PESTO-------------------------------
      1 ts Whole White Or Black
           Peppercorns
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Fresh
           Cilantro Roots Or Leaves
           And Stems
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Garlic
 
  CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortor and pestle or a spice grinder, crush or
  grind the peppercorns to a fine powder.  Combine the pepper, cilantro roots
  and garlic; work the three inngredients innto a fairly smooth paste in the
  mortor or in a small blender or food processor.  If you use a blender or
  food processor, you may need to add a little vegetable oil or water to ease
  the grinding.  Make about 1/4 cup.  For an industrial strength batch use 1
  tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the
  pesto for later use, put in a glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface
  to cover it and seal tightly.  It will keep nicely for about 1 week in
  the refrigerator.
  
  CLAY POT SHRIMP:  Place the noodles in a large bowl and add warm water to
  cover.  Soak the noodles until they become limp and white, about 15
  minutes.  Drain and set aside.  You should have about 5 cups softened
  noodles.  In a large clay pot or flameproof, heavy-bottomed casserole, heat
  the oil over medium heat until hot, about 1 minute.  Add the pesto and
  stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute, adding a little more oil if it
  sticks or burns.  Add the ginger and shrimp and stir-fry for 1 minute.
  Toss in the green onion, turning the mixture once more.  Transfer the
  shrimp
  to a plate and set aside while you prepare the noodles and sauce. In a
  small bowl, combine the chicken stock, fish sauce (Nam Pla), oyster sauce,
  rice wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and salt; stir to mix well. Place
  the
  soaked noodles in the clay pot in which you cooked the shrimp mixture.
  Scrape the shrimp mixture over the noodles and pour in the chicken stock
  mixture.  Toss the noodles and shrimp a little to combine them with the
  sauce, then cover the pot tightly.  Place the clay pot over medium heat and
  cook until the noodles are soft and clear and the shrimp is done, about 10
  minutes.  Sprinkle with the cilantro leaves and serve at once.

  it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.  Remove from heat to cool cover
  and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the
  top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another
  large pot.  Return the broth to the stock pot.  Go through the collander
  and remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard.  Next, go through the
  turkey remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any
  left over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to
  the pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place
  over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the egg noodles
  per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just long enough to cook
  the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy.
  Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to
  heat noodles and serve.

      Title: HURRY TUNA, PLEASE
 Categories: Casseroles, Seafood
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           -----INGREDIENTS-----
      1    Large 12-1/2-ounce can white
           Or light meat tuna, drained
      2 tb Vegetable Oil
      1    Apple; cored and chopped
      1 sm Onion; chopped
    1/2 ts Curry
      3 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Chicken bouillon; (that's
           -one cube of bouillon in one
           -cup of water)
      1    (8-ounce) package egg
           Noodles; cooked & drained
           Or
      1 c  Cooked rice
 
  THIS MEAL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRECK AND QUICK TO MAKE
  
       Fry the apple and onion in a little oil until lightly cooked. Add
  flour and slowly stir in milk and bouillon. That will make a lumpy white
  sauce.  (The lumps are from the apple and onions and are not your fault.)
  Add tuna, breaking it up well, and sprinkle in the curry. Mix well. Serve
  over hot noodles which take nine minutes to cook and should have been
  started back while the apples and onions were cooking. If time is not a
  problem, serve this over rice.  (Now that should have been started BEFORE
  the apples and onions.)

      Title: BUBBIE'S DAIRY NOODLE KUGEL
 Categories: Ethnic, Pasta
      Yield: 10 servings
 
     16 oz Noodle; cooked package/fine
      6    Eggs
    1/2 c  Sugar; to taste
      1    Margarine; melted
      1 c  Sour cream
      1 c  Cottage cheese
           Salt; to taste
    1/2 c  Raisins ; optional golden
 
  Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, drain well.
  Add the other ingredients and mix until combined. Put into a 9 x 13 baking
  dish (greased) and bake at 350 degrees for an hour. Never fails.
  
  You can serve with fruit (fresh) or put pie filling over it. Try putting
  some sour cream on top. Enjoy You can incorperate the egg yolks and beat
  the whites for a very light texture. I sometimes add a bit of lemon juice.
  
  This is a very forgiving recipe. If you leave the sour cream, sugar and
  raisins out, you have a wonderful salt kugel to serve with chicken or beef.

      6    Egg
           Salt; pepper to taste
    1/4 lb Margarine; parve or
           -butter if dairy is OK
      1 lb Noodles,
 
  This is the simplest way to make a kugel and in my mind the best! Combine
  butter with hot cooked noodles, Add eggs and stir until blended in. Season
  to taste. put in 9 x 13 pan and bake at 350 for one hour. Serve with
  roasted anything. It's a forgiving recipe. For a lighter taller kugel..beat
  whites first; but I never do!   This is the good old fashioned way of
  serving what's   'bad' for you but tastes so good. These days i only make
  it for special occasions...like when little Sara comes to dinner.

      Title: PAD THAI PSEUDO-VEGETARIAN STYLE
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce
    1/4 c  White vinegar; plus:
      2 tb White vinegar
      4 tb Sugar (less if desired)
      1 ts Paprika
      8 oz Thai rice noodles
           -- (about 1/4" thick)
      8 oz Tofu
      2 tb Dried shrimp (optional)
      3 tb Oil
      2    Garlic cloves (or more)
      2    Eggs
    3/4 lb Bean sprouts
      3    Green onions
           - sliced on the diagonal,
           - including white part
    3/4 c  Ground peanuts
      1 tb Roasted red chili peppers *
 
  * [Take some dried red chili peppers and cook them in an ungreased wok over
  low stirring constantly until they start to brown. Grind in a coffee
  grinder or spice mill.]
  
  Instructions: ============= Combine first four ingredients and let sit
  until sugar dissolves.  Soak rice noodles/sticks in warm water until they
  are soft but don't disintegrate when pressed, about 40 minutes. Drain.
  Drain tofu by wrapping it in a clean towel and pressing with a large can of
  tomatoes, about 30 minutes. Cut into 1/4 inch cubes. Rinse dried shrimp in
  water and drain.
  
  Put oil in wok, heat to medium, put in crushed garlic.  Swirl around for
  about a minute.  Add noodles and mix around for a minute or two.
  
  Add the tofu and shrimp then immediately add the liquid.  Keep stirring
  until the liquid has all been absorbed into the noodles, about a couple of
  minutes.
  
  Lower heat to low or medium-low.  Push some of the stuff aside at one end
  of wok, and break an egg in.  Immediately cover with noodles.  Do the same
  at the other end of wok.  Let the eggs cook *undisturbed* until the yolks
  are practically cooked, about three minutes.  (*Carefully* peak if unsure.)
  Slip a slotted spoon under each egg in turn, and bring upward, through the
  noodles, shaking as you go.  The idea is to break up the cooked egg into
  the rest of the mixture into tiny bits.
  
  Mix in sprouts and green onions.  Let cook for another two minutes. Turn
  off heat.  Add crushed peanuts and enough roasted red chilies to your
  desired hotness.

      Title: PAD THAI (SAUTEED RICE NOODLES)
 Categories: Thai, Rice, Pasta
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     16 oz Rice noodles
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      5    Garlic cloves (or more)
           -- finely chopped
      1 lb Medium shrimp
           -- shelled and deveined
      2    Firm-style bean curd squares
           -- cut into 1/2 inch cubes
    1/4 c  Pickled turnips
           -- (coarsely chopped)
    1/2 c  White vinegar
   3/16 c  Fish sauce
      1 tb Paprika
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs; beaten
    1/4 lb Mung bean sprouts
      3    Scallions
           -- cut into 1/2 inch pieces
    1/2 c  Ground unsalted peanuts
      1    Fresh red chili pepper
           -- seeded & coarsely chopped
      1    Lemon; cut into wedges
           Coriander leaves for garnish
    1/4 c  Crushed red pepper (opt.)
 
  In a large bowl, soak the rice noodles in 10 to 12 cups of cold water for 2
  hours.  Drain and cover with a damp towel to retain moisture.
  
  In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil and stir-fry the garlic until it
  is light brown.  Add the shrimp, bean curd and pickled turnips; stir in the
  vinegar, fish sauce, paprika and sugar.  When thoroughly mixed, fold in the
  noodles.  When the noodles are completely coated, spread them out to the
  sides of the wok or frying pan, leaving a space in the middle. Add the
  beaten eggs.  As the eggs cook, fold the noodles over them and stir to
  combine all of the ingredients evenly.  Stir in half of the bean sprouts,
  then add the scallions, ground peanuts and chopped chili pepper. Toss
  several times to mix well.
  
  Serve on a large platter with lemon wedges.  Top with the remaining bean
  sprouts and garnish with coriander leaves.  Serve the crushed red pepper on
  the side, for those who like it extra-spicy.

      Title: PAD THAI WITH SHRIMP
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8 oz Small size rice noodles
      3 tb Tomato sauce
           -OR- tamarind paste
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb Pickled radish
      3 tb Sugar
    1/3 c  Water or chicken stock
      1    Egg
      3 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 lb Shrimp, cleaned and shelled
      1    Handful bean sprouts (fresh)
           -- chopped once or twice
      2 oz Green onions
           -- cut into 1/2 inch pieces
      2 tb Finely chopped peanuts
 
  1.  Soak the rice noodles in cold tap water about 20 minutes, until they
  are "springy".  Then drain in a colander until needed.
  
  2.  If using dried tamarind, soak the tamarind in hot water for awhile,
  then mash with a fork to soften.  Force as much of the mixture as you can
  through a seive to remove bits of bark, etc.
  
  3.  Heat oil in wok, and add the tamarind/tomato sauce, picked radish, and
  sugar.  Mix well and let heat up.
  
  4.  Add the noodles, small portions at a time, and and that water/stock.
  Mix well until all the noodles are coated with the mixture.  Add more
  liquid if necessary -- it will cook out.  Don't be easy on the noodles ~-
  chop them with the spatula or spoon some to separate them.  It may help to
  "toss" the noodles like a salad, to get them coated.
  
  5.  Beat the egg and mix with the noodles.  Add the fish sauce and shrimp.
  Mix everything thoroughly.  The noodles will tend to "clump", so stir or
  "toss" like a salad to get everything mixed, and to ensure that the egg and
  shrimp cook thoroughly.  It will help to cover the wok with a lid for a
  minute or so, then toss the mixture, then cover again. You'll know it's
  done when the shrimp are completely pink.  There may be a little browning
  of the noodles; stirring will keep them from burning.
  
  6.  Add the bean sprouts, green onions, and chopped peanuts.  Mix well,
  then turn off the heat and let stand a minute or so.  Serve.

      Title: PAHT THAI
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb Coarsely chopped garlic
      8    Shrimps, peeled and deveined
      1    Egg; lightly beaten
      1 tb Fish sauce
      2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Coarsely chopped peanuts
           -- (dry-roasted type)
      1 c  Bean sprouts
      4    Slender green onions
           -- sliced in 1 inch lengths
      1    Lime; quartered lengthwise
 
  Paht Thai is a noodle dish almost everyone seems to like.  A tangle of
  slender rice noodles is sauteed with garlic, shallots, and an orchestra of
  sweet, sour, and salty ingredients that play a piquant symphony of Thai
  flavors.  A handful of fresh bean sprouts provides a cooling contrast to
  the hot, seasoned noodles, and circles of lime invite you to bring sourness
  to center stage as you begin to eat.
  
  Traditional ingredients are salty dried shrimp; crispy pieces of fried,
  pressed bean curd; sweet-sour nuggets of pickled white radish; chopped
  peanuts; flat, green garlic chives; and a balanced chorus -- sweet, sour,
  salty, hot -- of palm sugar, tamarind, vinegar, lime, brown bean sauce, and
  crushed dried red chilies.
  
  Thai cooks blithely tinker with the classic formula to create signature
  versions, and you can, too.  Siriluk Williams, owner of Sukothai Restaurant
  in Ft.  Lauderdale, Florida, gave me her recipe for home-style paht Thai. I
  love its accessible ingredients, simple steps, and delicious results.
  
  Instructions: ============= Soak rice noodles in warm water to cover for 15
  to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare all the remaining ingredients and place
  them next to the stove, along with a small serving platter. When the
  noodles are very limp and white, drain and measure out 2 1/2 cups. Set
  these by the stove as well.
  
  Heat a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon
  of the oil and swirl to coat the surface.  When the oil is very hot, drop a
  piece of the garlic into the pan.  If it sizzles immediately, the oil is
  ready.  Add the garlic and toss until golden, about 30 seconds. Add the
  shrimp and toss until they turn pink and are opaque, no more than 1 minute.
  Remove from the pan and set aside.
  
  Add the egg to the pan and tilt the pan to spread it into a thin sheet. As
  soon as it begins to set and is opaque, scramble it to break it into small
  lumps.  Remove from the pan and set aside with the shrimp.
  
  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, heat for 30 seconds, and add the
  softened noodles.  Using a spatula, spread and pull the noodles into a thin
  layer covering the surface of the pan.  Then scrape them into a clump again
  and gently turn them over.  Hook loops of noodles with the edge of the
  spatula and pull them up the sides, spreading them out into a layer again.
  Repeat this process several times as the stiff, white noodles soften and
  curl into ivory ringlets.  Add the fish sauce and turn the noodles so they
  are evenly seasoned.  Add the sugar and peanuts, turning the noodles a few
  more times.
  
  Reserving a small handful for garnish, add the bean sprouts, along with the
  green onions and shrimp-egg mixture.  Cook for 1 minute, turning often.
  Transfer the noodles to the serving platter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime
  wedges over the top.  Garnish with remaining bean sprouts and lime wedges
  and serve at once.
  
  Serves 1 as a main course, 2 as an appetizer.

  minutes or until lightly browned, stirring constantly.  Remove the noodles
  from the skillet, reserving the oil.  Reserve the noodles.  Cook the onion
  and garlic in the reserved oil until tender.  Stir in the tomatoes, chile
  peppers, sugar, vinegar, salt, cinnamon, and cloves.  Bring to boiling then
  reduce the heat.  Boil gently, uncovered, for about 15 minutes or until
  slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.  Meanwhile, cook the browned
  noodles in a large amount of boiling salted water until tender, about 7 to
  8 minutes, then drain.  In another skillet, heat the 1 tbls of oil just
  until hot.  Carefully break the eggs into the skillet, sprinkle with a
  little salt and pepper.  When the whites are set and the edges are cooked,
  add the 1 tbls of water.  Cover and cook the eggs until they are done as
  you like them.  Combine the noodles and half of the tomato sauce, transfer
  to a heated platter.  Arrange the eggs on top the noodles.  Spoon the
  remaining tomato mixture over the eggs.  Seed, peel and slice the avocado.
  Arrange the slices in a sunburst fashion over the eggs and serve hot.

     15 oz Fresh ricotta
      4 c  Grated mozzarella cheese
    1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan

      Title: FETTUCINE ALFREDO
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 c  Unsalted (sweet) butter,
      1 lb Fresh Fettucine noodles
    1/2 c  Light cream (or diluted
           -Creme Fraiche),
      1 c  Freshly grated parmesan
           -cheese,
      1    Pinch of nutmeg,
      1    Pinch of fresh parsley
           -(optional),
      1    Little pepper (optional).
 
  Put water on to boil for the noodles.  As the water comes to  a boil, start
  preparing  the sauce.  In  a  separate  pan  melt unsalted (sweet) butter
  over very low heat - DO  NOT  LET  IT BROWN!!
  
  Once  the butter has melted, stir into the butter: light  cream (or the
  diluted Creme Fraiche), freshly grated parmesan cheese. Beat this with a
  whisk to keep the sauce from clumping.   Once the sauce is smooth, season
  the sauce with a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of fresh parsley (optional), and
  a  little   pepper (optional).
  
  Turn the sauce down to a simmer and add fresh Fettucine noodles (or a batch
  of homemade noodles) to the boiling  water.   When the noodles are cooked
  al dente, drain and toss  gently  with sauce. Serve immediately.
  
  The order of these steps is important, as it is better to  make the sauce
  wait for the noodles than to make the  noodles  wait for the sauce.

  PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta dough.  Roll as thin as possible and cut
  into 2-inch wide stripe or approximately 4-inch squares.  Grate the
  Parmesan cheese. For The Bolognese Sauce, dice the onion, carrot, and
  celery. Mince the garlic. Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat; add the
  pork and cook until it just loses its pink color, about 3 minutes. Add
  onion, carrot, and celery; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic;
  cook 1 minute. Add wine, stirring with wooden spoon to deglaze pan; simmer
  until reduced by 1/2, about 15 minutes.  Add heavy cream and nutmeg; simmer
  until thickened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes and their juice,
  breaking up with a wooden spoon.  Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring
  occasionally, for 2 hours.  Season with salt and pepper. For The Bechamel
  Sauce, melt butter on low heat in a saucepan. Whisk in the flour and cook 1
  minute.  Gradually whisk in the milk and bring to a boil, stirring
  constantly.  Reduce heat; season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 20
  minutes. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
  tender, about 3 minutes for fresh pasta.  Drain and refresh under cold
  water.  Pour a thin layer of Bolognese Sauce into bottom of baking dish.
  Arrange a layer of pasta on top.  Pour 1/3 of the Bolognese and then 1/3 of
  the Bechamel over pasta.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Repeat for 2
  more layers, ending with the Parmesan cheese.  NOTE:  Lasagne can be made
  to this point a day ahead (OR can be frozen). COOKING AND SERVING: Heat
  oven to 400F.  Loosely cover lasagne with foil and bake until warmed
  through, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and put lasagne under broiler until
  golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Let lasagne sit for 10 minutes before
  serving.

  make life easy for myself; but once in awhile.... Add salt to eggs,add eggs
  to flour. mix with your hands until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl.
  It should be fairly stiff. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic. Roll
  out on a lightly floured board (or on a white cloth). Roll and stretch
  until it is paper thin...well very thin. Cut into 3" squares. Place one T
  of filling in center of each square and fold to make a triangle. Crimp
  edges with a fork and cook in boiling water. If you have a pasta machine
  (or I sometimes use FP go for it. Cook until they rise to the top; about 10
  or 12 minutes. DO NOT COOK IN THE SOUP. You may warm them in the soup.
   FILLINGS. These days I zap all the ingredients for each type of filling in
  the FP...leaving the eggs for last. For the cheese filling, you just want
  to combine. I would serve all but the cheese with Chicken Noodle soup. the
  Cheese Kreplach are usually served on the side (for a dairy meal) with sour
  cream. Each of these recipes makes about 30; figure at least 3 each

      Title: MEE KROB (SWEET THAI NOODLES)
 Categories: Thai, Pasta, Misc
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar (white granulated)
      1 c  Vinegar (white)
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 lb Dried shrimp (Kung Haeng)
      8 ea Serrano chilies
      1 bn Green onions (whites only)
      8 oz Tofu, firm or extra firm
      3 ea Eggs
      2 c  Vegetable oil (approx. amnt)
    1/4 lb Rice noodles (very thin)
 
  1.  Combine the water, sugar, vinegar, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring
  the mixture to a gentle boil and cook about ten minutes, until it forms a
  thin syrup.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Put the dried shrimp in a sieve and rinse them thoroughly under running
  water.  Set them aside in the sieve to drain.  Remove the stems, but not
  the seeds, from the chilies.  Slice the green onions and chilies lengthwise
  into thin strips and set them aside together.
  
  3.  Slice the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and set aside.  Beat the eggs
  lightly, until they are well mixed but not frothy.  Strain through a fine
  sieve and set aside.
  
  4.  Pour about three inches of oil in a wok and heat it to 400 degrees F.
  Dry the tofu with paper towels and deep fry it until the cubes are firm and
  light golden, but not dry and hard.  Remove them from the oil and set aside
  to drain on paper towels.
  
  5.  Using the same oil, deep fry the noodles a handful at a time.  The
  noodles will puff up immediately and begin to turn brown in about ten
  seconds.  (Note: these are the same type of noodles that are used to make
  chinese chicken salad.)  Be careful not to let them burn.  They should be
  light golden and very puffy.  If they do not expand immediately upon
  touching the oil, the oil is not hot enough.  If they turn dark
  immediately, the oil is too hot.  Scoop the noodles out to drain on paper
  towels.  Remove about half the oil from the wok and save it for another
  use.
  
  6.  Dribble the beaten, sieved eggs over the surface of the hot oil in the
  wok, to form narrow strands: holding the bowl of eggs in one hand, dip the
  other into the eggs, stretch it out about 12 inches over the oil, and let
  the egg run in a thin, steady stream from your fingertips while moving your
  hand in a circular motion so the surface of the oil is covered wit a thin
  net of egg.  You will need to repeat this procedure about four times. The
  intent is to create a thin net of egg strands that will cook quickly
  without massing together.  When the strands are set completely and light
  golden on the bottom, flip them over carefully and brown the other side.
  Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.
  
  7.  Dry the shrimp thoroughly with paper towels.  Using the same oil, deep
  fry the shrimp until they are just crisp and light golden, about three
  minutes.  Be prepared for the very strong smell they produce as they fry,
  but don't be concerned, since the shrimp will taste nothing like they
  smell.  (You may wish to do this well in advance of the time your guests
  will arrive and set the shrimp aside to drain on paper towels.)  They will
  form a great deal of foam while they are frying, and it will be necessary
  to use a strainer to lift them up occasionally to see how well they are
  cooking.  Do not over cook them or let them get dry or hard!  Remove them
  from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Discard the remaining oil.
  
  8.  Clean the wok thoroughly and place half the sugar syrup from step 1 in
  it.  Heat the syrup almost to boiling, but do not let it boil.  Add half
  the noodles, half the egg nets (see the variation below), half the tofu,
  and half the shrimp.  Mix gently until the syrup is absorbed, being careful
  to break the noodles as little as possible.  Remove the mixture from the
  wok and place it on a serving platter.  Repeat this step with the rest of
  the syrup, noodles, eggs, and shrimp.
  
  9.  Garnish the Mee Krob with the green onion whites and chilies.  Serve
  immediately or hold it at room temperature for up to two hours.
  
  VARIATION:  If the eggs have formed attractive nets (you should be so
  lucky!), you may drape them over the Mee Krob as a garnish rather than
  adding them in step 8.

      Title: CURRIED FROGS' LEGS - ECH NAU CA-RI
 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4    Pairs of jumbo frog's legs
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass, or
      1 tb Dried lemon grass
      2    Fresh red chilies, seeded
           -and sliced
      2    Shallots, sliced
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Curry paste
      2 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Nuoc mam (fish sauce)
      2 oz Cellophane noodles
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1 c  Chicken broth or water
    1/2 c  Coconut milk or heavy cream
      1 ts Cornstarch
           Fresh ground black pepper
           Coriander sprigs for garnish
 
  This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from southern
  Vietnam. If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more chile peppers.
  
  Cut the frogs' legs into bite-size pieces. Rinse with cold water to remove
  any chipped bones. Pat dry and refrigerate.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half
  of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you are using dried
  lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain and finely chop.
  
  In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots, garlic,
  sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce.
  Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the frogs' legs. Cover and
  refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain.
  Cut into 2-inch sections.
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute
  until translucent. Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all sides, about 3
  minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover
  and simmer for 15 minutes.
  
  Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1
  tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish sauce. Cook,
  stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.
  
  Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove from the
  heat.
  
  Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.
  
  Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles.
  
  Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush it and
  cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor. Remove the stalk before
  serving.
  
  Yield: 4 servings.

      6 oz Dried flat rice noodles (see
           -note)
      4 tb Vegetable oil
    1/4 lb Medium shrimp, shelled and
           -deveined
      1    Boneless chicken breast
           -half, skinned, thinly
           -sliced
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      3 tb Yellow bean sauce
      3 tb Tomato paste
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1    To 2 tablespoons distilled
           -vinegar
      2 tb Sugar
      3    Eggs
      2 tb Chopped preserved radish,
           -soaked in warm water for
     10    Minutes, drained (optional)
      1 tb Small dried shrimp
           -(optional)
      1    Inch cubes fried tofu, cut
           -into 1/2-inch slices
           -(optional)
           Big pinch chile flakes
      2    Handfuls bean sprouts,
           -tailed
      2    To 4 tablespoons chicken
           -broth or water, as needed
      4    Green onions, trimmed, cut
           -into 2-inch lengths
           GARNISHES:
      2 tb Coarsely chopped roasted
           -peanuts
           Chile flakes
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
      2    Limes, cut into wedges
 
  Place noodles in a bowl and cover with warm water; let soak about 15
  minutes, or until soft and pliable. Drain; set aside.
  
  Set a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.
  Add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry until shrimp turns bright orange and
  chicken turns white, about 30 seconds. Set aside.
  
  Reheat wok over medium heat. Add the remaining oil and the garlic; brown
  gently (about 20 seconds). Increase heat to medium- high. Add the bean
  sauce, tomato paste, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar; stir until sugar
  dissolves.
  
  Increase heat to high. Break 1 of the eggs into the sauce; beat 3 or 4
  times. Let cook until egg is slightly set but still moist, about 20
  seconds. Repeat with second and third egg. There should be tiny flecks of
  egg peeking through.
  
  Add the optional radish, dried shrimp and tofu, the chile flakes, softened
  noodles and 1 handful of bean sprouts to the hot wok. Toss and lift noodles
  until tender and no longer stiff, about 3 or 4 minutes.
  
  Add the chicken broth 2 tablespoons at a time if noodles seem dry, the
  green onions and the reserved shrimp/chicken mixture; toss for 30 seconds
  to reheat. The sauce is not a wet sauce; it should "dry-coat" the noodles.
  
  Transfer to a platter and serve with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts, chile
  flakes to taste and fresh coriander leaves. Arrange. remaining bean sprouts
  and lime wedges around noodles. (Squeeze lime over noodles before eating.)
  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Note: Traditionally, Pad Thai uses dried, flat Y4-inch-wide fettuccine-like
  rice-flour noodles, labeled "Chantaboon rice sticks."

  In this popular Cantonese teahouse specialty, the rice noodles are
  permeated with an aromatic infusion of curry spices and herbs, seasonings
  borrowed from Indian and Malay cooking-- both cuisines are indigenous to
  Singapore.
  
  Cover mushrooms with warm water. When soft and pliable, remove and squeeze
  dry. Cut off and discard stems. Cut caps into thin slices.
  
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles; using chopsticks, stir
  and loosen noodles. When soft and pliable, about 30 seconds, drain them
  into a colander. Cover and let cool.
  
  Preheat wok until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 slice of the ginger,
  the chicken, shrimp and pork; stir-fry until shrimp and chicken feel firm
  to the touch, about 1 minute. Remove and set aside. Pick out and discard
  ginger.
  
  To hot wok add remaining oil, ginger and salt, crushing ginger against
  sides of wok. When oil is hot, toss in onions, celery, snow peas,
  mushrooms, bell pepper and green onion; stir- fry until tender and crisp (1
  to 2 minutes). Push vegetables to side of wok. Add curry powder to center
  of wok and lightly saute for 10 seconds. Then add sugar, soy sauce and
  chicken stock. Mix.
  
  Add noodles; combine,with vegetables by using chopsticks, to lift, shake
  and separate strands of noodles, until they are evenly coated with sauce,
  moist but not wet and begin to cling to each other. (Add more chicken stock
  if noodles seem too dry). Return meat mix mixture, taste for seasoning.
  Toss to heat through.

    1/2 c  Dried shrimp
      1    Egg
      1 ts Water
    1/2 lb Barbecued pork
      2    Stalks celery
      2 c  Bean sprouts, blanched
      1    Medium yellow onion
      1    Green bell pepper
      1    Medium firm tomato
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 ts Fresh ginger, minced
      1 tb Curry powder
      4 tb Peanut oil

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Stock
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Chili oil
 
  Noodles:  Rinse shrimp noodles.  Boil noodles in water until cooked but
  still firm.  These thin noodles only take about 3 minutes to reach this
  stage.  Drain, reserving boiling water, & rinse with cold water until
  noodles are cooled & will not stick together.  Place in oiled bowl,
  refrigerate until firm.  The noodles must be firm before frying. Can be
  prepared day before.
  
  Preparation:  Wash & soak dried shrimp for 30 minutes; cut into thin
  pieces. Combine egg & water; cook as very thin omelet; cool; slice into 2"
  long shreds. Thinly slice pork to match. Blanch bean sprouts in noodle
  water (this water will have other uses, so hold onto it). Peel strings off
  celery stalks, thinly slice. Peel & halve onions, slice thinly. Core
  pepper, slice thinly in 2" lengths. Slice tomato in thin wedges. OR: slice
  these vegetables to match size of bean sprouts for better looking dish (a
  good shredder does this job quickly). Mix sauce ingredients in bowl.
  
  Stir-fry:  Add 1/2 of peanut oil to hot wok.  When oil begins to smoke,
  toss in garlic, ginger, shrimp & vegetables, except tomato; stir-fry on
  high heat for 2 minutes. Add sauce, & continue cooking until sauce reduces
  by half. Remove to holding bowl.
  
  Rinse wok; return to high heat; when it is dry, reduce heat to medium & add
  remaining peanut oil.  Heat oil to moderate (don`t let it smoke); add curry
  powder, stirring to mix with oil. Avoid burning curry; if it burns, start
  over.  Cook curry powder for about 30 seconds. Add noodles a fist-full at a
  time, breaking noodles into short pieces. Toss noodles to coat & heat them.
  When hot, add cooked shrimp & vegetables; toss together to mix. Turn off
  heat. Add pork, egg shreds & tomato wedges; mix together. Serve. By the
  time dish is on the table, tomatoes will be hot, but still firm.

  flavors typical of Thai cuisine. From "Thai Cooking From the Siam Cuisine
  Restaurant" (North Atlantic Books, 1989).
  
  Pound dried shrimp in a mortar to flatten them into soft, crumbly pieces.

  strainer to hold the noodles, dip them into boiling for 1 second. Remove
  and immediately dip into ice water to stop the cooking. Drain well and set
  aside.
  
  Using a strainer to hold the prawns, boil for 6 seconds until they turn
  pink. Drain well.
  
  Combine prawns and lime juice in a medium bowl; let stand 1 minute. Add the
  dried shrimp, noodles, fish sauce, sugar, mush- rooms rooms, celery, green
  onions and coriander leaves.

      Title: MARINATED CUCUMBER AND RED BELL PEPPER SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Ornish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 oz Dry cellophane or bean
           Thread noodles
      2 c  Peeled, seeded, and sliced
           Cucumbers
      2 c  Thinly sliced red bell
           Peppers (I chopped them into
           Chunks )
      1 c  No-oil Italian dressing or
           Vinaigrette (I used less
           Than 1C -- about 3/4)
      1 T  Freshly minced basil
      1 T  Freshly miced cilantro
    1/8 t  Red hot chili flakes (I made
           My own from dried chilis)
           Lettuce
 
  Drop the noodles into boiling water until done (length of time depends on
  type; read the label). Drain. Toss all ingredients together and marinate
  for at least 1 hour. Serve on a bed of lettuce.
  
  Other tips:
  
  I used 3.5 oz of noodles, and less dressing. The chili makes it hot so if
  you don't like spicy, it would be fine to leave it out. You may want to
  break the noodles a little before cooking (but not too much). I made the
  mistake of not breaking them and ended up having to cut them a little in
  order to get my ingredients to combine properly.
  
  This salad is even better the next day. I imagine it travels nicely because
  it isn't too soupy.

      Title: SUNOMONO OR JAPANESE NOODLE AND CUCUMBER SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Oriental
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5    To 6 oz. of dry vermicelli
           Noodles
      6 T  Rice vinegar
      4 t  Sugar
      2 t  Soy sauce
      1 t  Salt
      1    To 2 tbsp of sesame seeds
      1    Medium-sized cucumber
           - extra sesame seeds for the
           Top
           - scallion greens, thinly
           Sliced-optional (I used the
           Scallions greens)
 
  1) Cook the noodles in boiling water until just tender. Drain and rinse in
  cold water. Drain thoroughly, and transfer to a medium-sized bowl. (My
  advice, store in water if not using right away!) 2) Add vinegar, sugar, soy
  sauce, salt, and sesame seeds. Mix well. Cover and chill until cold. (Don't
  chill for too long or the noodles will stick together. I did this but was
  able to save it by adding more rice vinegar until the noodles separated
  again. It tasted great.) 3) Peel adn seed the cucumber. Cut into quarters
  lengthwise, then into thin pieces. If not serving right away, wrap the
  cucumber pieces in a plastic bag or plastic wrap and refrigerate. 4) To
  serve, divide the noodles amon 4 or 5 serving bowls. Top with a small
  handful of cucumber slices, a light sprinkling of sesame seeds, and , if
  desired, a few very thin slices of scallion greens. Serve cold.
  
  This salad is subtle adn very refreshing. There is a variety of
  textures-chewy cold noodles (bean thread noodles, some call them cellophane
  noodles 'cause when you boil them they become clear), crunchy sesame seeds,
  and smooth cucumber slices. Sweet, salt, and vinegar combine harmoniously,
  each understated but very much present.
  
  Everything except the cucumbers and toppings can be combined several days
  ahead of time. (I beg to differ on this claim because, if you don't keep
  the boiled noodles in cold water while setting them aside, they will stick
  together.) The cucumbers can be prepared ahead also, and kept separate
  until serving.
  
  Note: The dressing contains no oil. ( However the sesame seeds do)
  
  Prep time:  15 minutes, plus chilling time, Yield: 4 to 5 servings
  
  Bon Appetit!

 Categories: Digest, August, Lacto
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2    Box lasagna noodles
      1 cn (1 lb) fatfree vegetarian
           Refried beans
      1 c  Chunky salsa (any degree of
           Eat you prefer)
      1 c  Fatfree or 1% fat cottage
           Cheese
      1 c  Shredded fatfree (or low fat
           If desired) cheddar cheese
 
  Cook noodles according to package directions.  Rinse and drain.
  
  In a small saucepan, mix beans and salsa and heat over a medium flame until
  runny (helps to spread the mixture).  Place a small amount of the bean
  mixture in the bottom of a square 8 or 9 inch baking dish.  Layer four or
  five lasagna noodles over the dish (cut off extra length of noodle and save
  for the next noodle layer).  Spread 1/2 of the bean/salsa mix on top of
  noodles then top with 1/2 the cottage cheese and some of the cheddar. Top
  with more noodles then the remaining bean/salsa mix and cottage cheese. top
  with more cheddar and remaining noodles.  Top with a little more cheddar.
  Bake in microwave at medium-high for 10 minutes (uncovered) or in oven for
  30 minutes at 350 degrees (or until hot and bubbly).
  
  This was really good and alot easier than it sounds.  Giving a recipe for
  how you layer lasagna is really a pain!

      Title: BEAN LASAGNE
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 cn Ff vegetarian refried beans
      1    12 oz bottle mild taco
           Sauce
      2 cn Stewed tomatoes, one
           Drained, one not
      1 c  Ff cottage cheese
      1 c  Corn kernels, frozen is ok
     10    To 12 lasagne noodles,
           Uncooked
    1/4 c  Black olives, sliced
 
  In a bowl mix beans with about half the juice from one can of tomatoes and
  a couple of tablespoons of taco sauce. You want the beans to be almost but
  not quite pourable. Mix the rest of the taco sauce and tomato juice and set
  aside.
  
  Put about a quarter of the taco sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13"
  lasagne pan. Cover sauce with a layer of noodles. Layer, in any order you
  want, the beans, corn, cheese, drained tomatoes, sauce and noodles, being
  sure to end up with enough beans to cover the top with no noodles showing.
  The resulting mess should be pretty wet.
  
  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake at 350 for about an hour, until the noodles
  are tender. Check every 5-10 minutes after 45 minutes of cooking to see how
  the noodles are doing. Remove foil, sprinkle with olives. Bake another
  couple of minutes. Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving.
  
  Serves 3-4 as a main dish. Tastes even better the next day.
  
  Variation: If you want to pre-cook the noodles, don't use as much tomato
  juice and cook for only about 30 minutes.
  
  Variation: Other veggies would work well in here too. What do you have in
  the frig?
  
  Variation: You could top it with a little ff cheese-stuff in the last few
  minutes. And no doubt you could make it vegan by leaving off all milk
  products altogether.

           I forgot!
           Italian herbs to taste
    1/2 c  Fatfree Parmesan
 
  All measurings except the six noodles (which serves 2) are approximate.
  Really, I guess you can put in about anything you like.  I left the
  mushrooms out of Ben's because he's weird that way.  Anyway, stuff this
  mixture into the shells. You may have some left over. So sue me.  Put them
  in a baking dish and pour one jar of Healthy Choice f/f spaghetti sauce
  over the noodles.   Bake at 400 F for about 45 minutes.  This is very easy
  and I hope you like it as well as we do. Mangia!

           Medium-size egg noodles,
           Uncooked
    1/2 c  Chopped onion

    1/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
      3 T  All-purpose flour

      1 T  Poppy seeds
      1 t  Salt
    1/8 t  Red pepper
      3 c  Diced cooked tofu
      1    (4-ounce) jar diced
           Pimiento, drained
      2 T  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Cook noodles according to package directions.  Drain well, and set aside.
  Sauti onion and green pepper in butter in a Dutch oven until tender; add
  flour, stirring until smooth.  Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.
  Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
  thickened and bubbly.  Stir in noodles, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, poppy
  seeds, salt, red pepper, and tofu; add pimiento, and stir gently. Spoon
  mixture into a lightly greased 12- x 8- x 2-inch baking dish. Cover and
  chill 8 hours.  To bake, remove from refrigerator, and let stand at room
  temperature 30 min.  Bake, covered, at 350 for 45 min.  Uncover, and
  sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese.  Bake, uncovered, an additional 10 min.
  or until thoroughly heated.
  
  1. I use one pound of tofu cut into 1 inch squares instead of turkey.  (I
  am a vegitarian.)
  
  2. It does not have to refrigerate, but the tastes do mingle better if it
  does.
  
  3. I usually sprinkle more than 2 tablespoons of cheese on top.

  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      2 T  Cornstarch
      3 T  Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 T  Garlic, minced
  1 1/2 T  Ginger, minced

      2 c  Carrots, shredded
  1 1/2 T  Rice wine
      4 c  Bean sprouts
 
  Heat 1 gallon water in large pan until boiling.  Add noodles and cook
  until just tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain.  Toss with 1-2 teaspoons
  sesame oil.  Immediately transfer noodles to round cake pan or pie plate.
  Press top to level noodles and let cool.  This can be made a day ahead and
  refridgerated. In the meantime, cut leeks & re-hydrated mushroom caps into
  fine julienne strips.  Discard mushroom stems.  Rinse and drain bean

  vegetable oil and heat until nearly smoking.  Invert noodle cake into pan
  and cook until deep-golden brown, swirling pan from time to time to keep
  cake from sticking.  Flip noodle cake over and brown other side.  Transfer
  noodles to heat-proof serving platter and keep warm in oven at 200
  degrees.
  Reheat pan and add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil.  Again, heat

   Nothing is more fascinating and delicious than eating at the open-
  air street hawker centers in Asia, particularly in Singapore.  Each
  stall serves a specialty, typically an honest, unpretentious,
  home-style dish for $1 to $3 a plate.
   This rice noodle dish is hawker food at its best.  If done right, its
  fragrance will tell you how good it's going to be as soon as it
  arrives at your table.  Singapore hawkers will use whatever seafoods
  are available, including cockles and sliced fish cakes in addition to
  those suggested in this recipe.  Feel free to experiment.
   1.  Steam the sausages for 10 minutes.  Cut them in thin diagonal
  slices. Toss the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Let them
  stand for 10 minutes, rinse well with cold water, drain, and pat dry.
  Cut the squid into 1/4 inch rings and tentacles.  Cut the barbecued
  pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Combine the white pepper, soy
  sauces, and oyster sauce in a bowl; set aside.
   2.  Just before cooking, put the noodles in a large bowl and pour
  boiling water over them.  Stir gently with chopsticks to separate the
  strands, drain, and shake off the excess water.
   3.  Preheat a wok; when hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the
  remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the garlic, shallots, and chiles and
  cook over medium-high heat until the garlic is golden brown.
  Increase the heat to high and toss in the shrimp and squid; stirfry
  until the shrimp turn bright orange and the squid looks opaque white,
  about 2 minutes. Add the sausage slices, barbecued pork, bean
  sprouts, and cabbage; toss and stir until the vegetables begin to
  wilt.  Remove everything in the wok to a platter and set aside.
   4.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the wok; when hot,
  toss in the well-drained noodles.  Gently toss and flip the noodles
  to heat them through.  Be careful not to break them; it is okay if
  they brown slightly. Push the noodles up the sides of the wok to make
  a well in the middle; pour in the soy sauce mixture, then toss the
  noodles gently to sauce them evenly.  Make a well again and break the
  eggs into the middle. Without mixing them with the noodles, scramble
  the eggs lightly. When the eggs begin to set, add the green onions
  and return the seafood mixture. Gently toss together to reheat and
  mix.  Serve hot, with a hot chill sauce for seasoning to taste.
  Garnish with coriander sprigs.
   NOTE:  Both here and in Asia, fresh rice noodles are usually
  purchased rather than made at home.  Look for them in Asian markets
  or Chinese take-out dim sum shops.  This dish can be prepared with
  dried rice noodles; however, it is worth taking the time to seek out
  the fresh variety.
   Make certain that your wok is well seasoned or the fragile rice
  noodles will break apart and stick to the pan.  Although I hesitate
  recommending that you cook with a non stick wok or skillet, they will
  work fine if you are more comfortable with them.
   TECHNIQUE NOTE; To clean squid, start by separating all the
  tentacles from the heads, cutting across as close as possible to the
  eyes.  Squeeze out and discard the hard, pea sized beak in the center
  of each cluster of tentacles.  Rinse the tentacles and drain them in
  a colander. Grasp the mantle (the saclike "body" of the squid) in one
  hand and the head in the other and pull apart; the entrails will pull
  out attached to the head. Pull the transparent quill out of each
  mantle.  Discard everything but the tentacles and mantles.  Running a
  little water into each mantle to open it up, reach in with a finger
  and pull out any entrails remaining inside. (Working over a second
  colander to catch all the debris will make cleanup easier.) You can
  remove the spotted outer skin or leave it on (I prefer to remove it).
  Transfer the cleaned mantles to a cutting board, slice them crosswise
  to the desired size,and add them to the tentacles in the colander.
  Give everything another rinse and drain thoroughly.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings

 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
     10 sm Black dried mushrooms
    1/2 lb Fresh Chinese egg noodles
           -(regular mein)
           Sesame oil
    1/2 lb Sea scallops
           Cornstarch
    1/2 lb Flank steak
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, sliced
      1 lb Bok choy, cut in 1 1/2-inch
           -lengths
      2    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  Fresh chicken stock
      2 tb Light soy sauce
           Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Peanut oil
      1 tb Or more dry sherry or
           -Shaoxing rice wine
 
  Here's a recipe for Chow Mein which is a pretty classic application
  using pan fried noodles.
  
  Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and pour boiling water over them.
  Let soak for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large quantity of boiling water for
  3 1/2 to 5 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, drain again, toss
  with a little sesame oil and set aside.
  
  Cut The scallops in half, toss with a little sesame oil and 1 1/2
  teaspoons of cornstarch; refrigerate.  Cut the flank steak as thinly
  as possible across the grain.  Toss with 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch,
  in a little sesame oil and the dark soy sauce; set aside.  When the
  mushrooms have soaked, squeeze them out over the soaking liquid, and
  reserve 1/4 cup of the liquid.  Cut off the mushroom stems and
  discard; cut the caps in two and set aside with the bamboo shoots and
  bok choy.
  
  Lightly beat the eggs with a few drops of sesame oil.  Heat a small
  frying pan and oil the bottom lightly.  Pour in enough of the beaten
  egg to cover the bottom, pouring any excess back into the uncooked
  eggs. Cook just until set and remove.  Repeat until all the egg is
  used up. Stack the egg crepes, roll them up and slice across the roll
  into shreds. Set aside.
  
  Mix the chicken stock with the light soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  and the sugar; set aside.  Heat this mixture in a small pot over low
  heat.
  
  Meanwhile, heat a wok over medium high heat until hot.  Add 1 cup
  peanut oil and heat until the oil is very hot.  Lower the noodles
  into the oil to form a nest and let them cook until brown on one
  side.  (This may take 8 minutes or so.) Turn the noodles over and
  brown on the other side. (This will be much faster.) Remove to a
  large serving platter and keep warm.
  
  Cook the scallops very briefly in the same oil, remove and drain in a
  colander.  Turn the heat off under the oil and add the beef.  Stir
  just until the meat slices are separated and start to change color.
  Remove to drain with the scallops.
  
  Pour off all the oil but 1/4 cup and heat.  Add the vegetables and
  stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the seasoned stock and bring to a
  boil. Mix the reserved mushroom soaking liquid with 2 tablespoons of
  cornstarch until dissolved and stir into the chicken stock sauce.
  Stir until it thickens and clears slightly.  Add the beef and
  scallops, then the wine and cook just until heated through.  Pour
  over the noodles and serve garnished with the egg shreds.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
-------------------------------ACCOMPANIMENTS-------------------------------
           Nuoc Cham
      1 bn Of mint
      1 bn Of coriander

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 oz Cellophane (bean thread)
           -noodles
      4 oz Lean ground beef
      4 oz Ground pork shoulder
      4 oz Fresh or canned crabmeat,
           -picked over and drained
      4    Shallots, minced
      4    Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 md Onion, minced
      1 c  Fresh bean sprouts
      2 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Egg

---------------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING---------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     24    Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang) each 8 1/2 inches
           -in diameter.
     24    Raw medium shrimp, peeled
           -with tail section
           -attached, deveined
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio.  These are *really* good!
  Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water.  Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round.  The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle.  The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown.  Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      6    Dried Chinese mushrooms
      1 tb Dried tree ear mushrooms
      6    Water chestnuts or 1/2
           -small jicama, peeled and
           -chopped
      4 oz Fresh or canned lump

      8 oz Raw shrimp, shelled,

      2 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      3    Eggs

---------------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING---------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     80 sm Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang), each 6 1/2 inches
           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles.  Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid.  Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care.  (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in
  batches, add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or
  let them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat
  for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove
  the rolls with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low
  oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham.  If served as
  an hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a
  main course.
  
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

           Vegetable Platter
      8 oz Thin rice vermicelli (bun)
           -OR:
      2 bn Japanese alimentary paste
           -noodles (somen).

      1 tb Dried tree ear mushrooms
      6    Dried Chinese mushrooms
      1 lg Carrot, finely shredded
      1 lg Leek, white part only,
           -chopped
      6    Water chestnuts, or
    1/2 sm Jicama, peeled and chopped
      1 lb Firm bean curd (tofu),

      1 c  Fresh bean sprouts, coarsely
           -chopped
      6    Garlic cloves, minced
      3 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      2    Eggs
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper

----------------------------ASSEMBLY AND FRYING----------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     40 sm Rounds of rice papers (banh
           -trang), 6 1/2 inches in
           -diameter
           Peanut oil for frying
 
  The book notes that true Buddhist vegetarians would not use garlic or
  fish sauce and would limit the dips to plain soy or plum sauce.
  Unless you are in this category, Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo) and Nuoc
  Cham are great dips as well.
  
  Prepare the Vegetable Platter, noodles and dipping sauce.  Set aside.
  
  Soak the noodles in warm water and the mushrooms in hot water for 30
  minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 1/2-inch lengths.  Remove and
  discard the stems from the mushrooms; squeeze to extract most of the
  soaking liquid.  Mince all of the mushrooms.
  
  Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; blend
  well with your hands.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a large bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.
  
  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with only 4 sheets at a time,
  keeping the remaining sheets covered with a barely damp cloth to
  prevent curling.
  
  Immerse the rice paper, one sheet at a time, into the sweetened warm
  water. Quickly withdraw it and lay it flat on a dry towel.  Do this
  with 4 sheets without letting them touch each other.  The rice paper
  will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press it into a
  compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely
  enclose the filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.  (The
  rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.)
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in batches, add
  some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick
  together. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and
  crisp.  Remove the rolls from the oil with tongs and drain on paper
  towels.  Keep warm in a low oven until all of th rolls are cooked.
  
  To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some
  noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the
  package in the dipping sauce.
  
  NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a
  350F oven just to crisp and heat through.
  
  Yield: 40 rolls.

      Title: KUNG OP WUN SEN (BAKED PRAWNS AND MUNGBEAN NOODLES)
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Prawns
      5    Coriander roots, crushed
      1 tb Pepper corns
      1    Onion, thinly sliced
      3 sl Ginger, crushed
      2 tb Cooking oil
      1 tb Maggi sauce
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Whiskey
      2 c  Mungbean noodles, soaked
           -and cut into short lengths
 
  Here's a goody that came out of my new Thai cookbook.  It's easy and
  quick to do and quite tasty.  It's a baked dish, which is unusual for
  Thai cooking.  I suspect that originally, it would have been steamed.
  Next time I'll try it that way or put a tablespoon of water or sherry
  in each bowl. It seemed a tad dry to me.  I cooked it in individual
  French onion soup bowls with lids.
  
  Place the oil in a wok, heat and stir fry the coriander root, ginger,
  pepper and onion.  When fragrant, remove from the wok and place in a
  mixing bowl.
  
  Add the noodles, the sauces. salt, sugar, sesame oil and whiskey,
  toss the noodles until well coated, and then add the prawns and toss
  well once again.
  
  Divide the noodles and prawns into four individual portions; place
  each portion in a lidded cup, and close the lids.  Place the cups on
  a baking tray and bake at 460F until the prawns are done (about 10
  minutes).
  
  Serve hot with fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes and spring onions.
  Serves four.
  
  From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon
  Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat.  SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.
  ISBN 0-943389-05-4.
  
  If you can buy coriander bunches with the roots untrimmed you'll be
  in good shape.  If not, substitute stems.  I left it out as the
  person I was eating with doesn't like coriander at all.  It doesn't
  say to, but I cracked the peppercorns slightly before adding them to
  the mix.  By light soy sauce, they mean like in thin soy, rather than
  as in "lite" soy sauce.
  
  Maggi Sauce is a condiment sauce++originating in France, I believe++
  popular in Asia.  It's somewhat like a slightly thick soy sauce.  It
  can be found in the gourmet sections of supermarkets as well as in
  Asian markets. If I didn't have any, I'd use thick Chinese soy in
  it's place. If you can find the Maggi Sauce grab it.  It lasts
  virtually forever in the fridge. Get a small bottle, though.  I run
  across very few recipes that call for it.  It's used as a table
  condiment in Asia and is often seen on the tables at Vietnamese
  restaurants here in the States.
  
  The mungbean noodles are the thin, clear "cellophane" noodles.  I'd
  have no qualms about using the similar thin rice noodles if I
  couldn't find mungbean ones.
  
  I picked up a neato garnish from the photo with this dish.  It shows a
  green onion "brush" with a slice of red pepper around the middle.
  Quite attractive and easy to make.  Cut a slice of scallion++the
  whitish part++about an inch and a half long.  Slice a fresh red chili
  into quarter-inch slices.  Take a length of scallion and push the
  seeds and pulp out of the chili slice.  Slip the rind down to the
  middle of the piece of scallion, then cut the exposed pieces of
  scallion with a thin, sharp blade all the way through.  Make two cuts
  vertically, then rotate the scallion and make two more cuts.  Do both
  ends, then toss the bundle into a bowl of water with lots of ice
  cubes and the slit ends will curl up making a nice, tassley looking
  garnish that's great to eat too.  The trick is to get chilies that
  are about the same diameter as the scallions so it's a snug fit.
  Just toss a couple of the chilly, frilly scallions into each bowl
  before serving.  It's a little touch, but it adds a lot to the
  appearance of the dish.

      Title: LAMB IN COOK POT
 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Lean, boneless lamb from
           -leg or shoulder
      2 oz Cellophane noodles
    1/4 lb Fresh spinach
    1/4 lb Celery cabbage
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      1    Tb sesame-seed oil
      1    Tb dry sherry
    1/2    Tb brown sugar dissolved in
           -1 tb boiling water
      1 tb Peanut butter thinned with
           -4 tb boiling water
    1/8 ts Pepper
    1/2    Tb mashed red bean curd
      4 c  Chicken stock fresh or
           -canned
      1    Finely chopped scallions
    1/2 ts Chopped garlic
    1/2    Tb finely chopped peeled
           -ginger root
    1/8 c  Finely chopped parsley
 
  I picked up a nice little Mongolian fire pot at a sale this weekend.
  That makes two that I have now.  The other is a highly polished brass
  museum piece that I never use for cooking because it's such a hassle
  to clean up. This one is smaller and, with the exterior parts being
  made of a matte finish aluminum, much easier to keep clean.  This is
  the kind you'd see in a Chinese or Japanese place and is just the
  right size for two to four diners.  This one also has a neato
  adjustable grate to control the heat.
  
  I found this recipe stuffed inside the pot.  It was hand-typed.  The
  amounts called for in it would be too much for the little pot I found
  it in, but is sounds quite good and is probably authentic.  You
  generally don't find Nam Yuey (red bean curd cheese) called for in
  Westernized recipes.  The pot is a neat touch, but this can be made
  just as effectively in a fondue pot or in a sauce pan on a tabletop
  burner++in anything that gets the broth hot enough to cook the
  ingredients.
  
  Freeze lamb for 2 or 3 hours for ease in slicing.  Cut against the
  grain into paper thin slices.  Then cut slices into 2 x 2 inch
  pieces. Cover cellophane noodles with 1 cup warm water and soak for
  30 minutes. Drain and cut into 6 inch lengths.  Wash spinach leaves
  under cold running water and pat dry with paper towel.  Arrange on
  platter along with noodles. Trim greens and root ends of the cabbage.
  Separate into stalks and wash thoroughly.  Cut each stalk into small
  pieces and drop into pot of boiling water.  Take out in 2 minutes,
  dry and place with spinach and noodles. Combine soy sauce,
  sesame-seed oil, sherry, brown sugar, peanut butter pepper and bean
  curd.  Mix thoroughly, then take 1 tablespoon of the sauce and put
  into each of 4 bowls.  Reserve the rest and place in small bowl.
  
  Preheat your broiler to its highest point.  Place 8 to 10 charcoal
  briquettes side by side in baking pan lined with heavy aluminum foil
  and place under broiler.  Heat for 10 to 15 minutes until white ash
  forms on briquettes.  Transfer to funnel of cook pot with tongs.  Put
  fireproof (asbestos) mat on table and place cook pot on it.  Bring
  chicken broth to a boil then pour it into the cook pot.  Give each
  person a plate of lamb and a soup bowl.  Drop the scallions, garlic,
  ginger, and parsley into the boiling stock.  Each person cooks own
  lamb with fondue fork and then dips it into sauce in soup bowl.
  Extra sauce is also placed on table.
  
  When the lamb has been used, ladle a little of the remaining stock
  into each bowl.  Add the noodles and vegetables in the remaining
  stock in the cook pot, for a minute or two then ladle with broth into
  bowls as another course.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: THAI GLASS NOODLES (YAM WOON SEN)
 Categories: Thai, Pasta, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 oz Dried mung bean noodles
      1 tb To 2 tb vegetable oil
      1    Whole chicken breast,
           -boned, skinned and
           -coarsely chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Fresh red or green chile,
           -chopped
      3 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
      1 ts Sugar
      3    Shallots, peeled, thinly
           -sliced
    1/2 c  Fresh coriander leaves
      6 oz Cooked bay shrimp
           Shredded lettuce
      1 tb To 2 tb crisp-fried shallots
           -(optional)
 
  This recipe comes from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, location of the
  Thai Cooking School.  It has been adapted for the American cook. With
  this recipe it's necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than
  those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when
  buying.
  
  Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.
  Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes).  Drain.  Add
  noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook
  until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes).  Drain in a
  colander; rinse with cold water; drain again.  Cut into 3 or 4 inch
  lengths.
  
  Chill.
  
  Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it
  loses it's pink color.  Break into small morsels.  Season with salt
  and pepper to taste.  Cool.
  
  Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and
  coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly.  Add chicken, shrimp
  and chilled noodles; mix well.
  
  Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp
  fried shallots.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.
  
  San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.
  
  As far as the crisp fried shallots go, they're easy to make.  Just
  fry some sliced shallots in a little oil until they're browned and
  crisp.  I wouldn't hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in
  the same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor
  accent. Good stuff!

      3 oz Dried mung bean thread
           -noodles
      1 sm Dungeness crabs [Or a
           -couple of whatever local
           -crabs you have.
           Dungeness crabs are BIG!
           -S.C.]
    1/2 ts Black peppercorns
      1 tb Chopped fresh coriander root
      4    Garlic cloves
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Golden Mountain Sauce, or
           -dark soy sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce, or Thai
           -fish sauce (Nam Pla)
      2 ts Oyster sauce
      1 tb Rice wine, or dry sherry
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 qt Slices of ginger, crushed
      4    Red chilies, chopped into
           -1/2 inch pieces
      6 oz Medium shrimp (36 to 40
           -per count), shelled,
           -deveined, patted dry
      4    Green onions, cut into
           -2-inch lengths
      1    To 1/2 cup water
      1 lb Fresh fish filets, cut into
           -1-inch pieces
    1/2 lb Large squid, cleaned, cut
           -crosswise into 1-inch rings
    1/2 c  Thai sweet basil leaves
           Fresh coriander sprigs
 
  Thailand is truly a place for seafood lovers.  There is water
  everywhere in Bangkok++even in the dry season.  And everywhere there
  is water, the Thais use it to grow something to eat!  Add to that the
  fact that the Gulf of Thailand is not far away from the city and it
  all adds up to good eatin' for seafood lover's!  The following recipe
  is typical of the bewildering variety of cioppino and jambalaya type
  seafood stews found there++and each one seems better than the last.
  The recipe is from Joyce Jue's delightful San Francisco Chronicle
  column (3/13/91).  It calls for the dish to be cooked in a Chinese
  "sandy" pot.  Don't gots one? Not to worry++use whatever you have on
  hand++wok, Dutch oven, stockpot...
  
  (And yes, Marge++there are tentacles in this!)
  
  Put the mung beans into a bowl and cover with warm water; soak until
  soft and pliable, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Set aside. If you are
  using a cooked crab, have the fishmonger crack it into large pieces.
  
  To clean a live crab, be careful, and use a brush to scrub its
  underside and between the claws and legs to loosen the sand and grit.
  Rinse thoroughly with cold water.  Plunge the crab into boiling water
  for a minute to kill it.  Remove.  When cool, clean, disjoint and
  chop the crab into large chunks.
  
  In a mortar or spice mill, pound or grind the peppercorns first, then
  add the coriander root and garlic, and work it into a paste.  Mix
  together the sugar, Golden Mountain, soy and oyster sauces, rice wine
  and sesame oil in a bowl.
  
  Pour the vegetable oil into a 3 1/2-quart sandy clay pot casserole
  (or a Dutch oven) and set over medium heat.  Add the
  coriander-garlic- pepper paste and saute lightly.
  
  Increase the heat to high.  Add ginger, chiles and raw crab pieces;
  toss and brown for a minute.  Add the shrimp an green onions to crab
  mixture; stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Pour in the soy sauce mixture and
  mung bean noodles; toss and mix together.  Stir in the water, cover
  pot, reduce heat to medium and braise for 8 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. If the noodles seem dry, add more water.
  
  Increase heat to medium-high, and gently stir in the fish and squid
  (and cooked crab if using), mix with the noodles, top with the basil
  leaves. Cover and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Check for
  doneness. Garnish with fresh coriander sprigs.  Bring the clay pot to
  the table and serve hot with rice and vegetables.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS (CHA GIO)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 oz Cellophane noodles,
           -soaked in warm water for
           -20 minutes, then drained
           -and cut onto 1-inch lengths
      1 lb Ground pork
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      2 tb Tree ears, soaked in warm
           -water for 30 minutes, then
           -drained and finely chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, finely
           -chopped
      3    Shallots or white part of 3
           -scallions, finely chopped
      1 cn (7 ounces) crabmeat,
           -cartilage removed and meat
           -flaked with fingers
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper

------------------------PREPARATIONS FOR ASSEMBLING------------------------
     20    Sheets dried rice papers
           -(banh trang)
      4    Eggs, well beaten
      2 c  Peanut oil

-------------------------ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR SERVING-------------------------
           Basic Vegetable Platter
           Carrot Salad
           Double recipe of Nuoc Cham
 
  Here they are!  The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.
  
  Yields 80 spring rolls.
  
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper
  on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over
  the entire surface of each of the pieces.  Before filling, wait for
  the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes
  about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on
  several wrappers at a time.
  
  When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of
  filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.  Fold the
  sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.
  
  After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,
  put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,
  and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown.  (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).
  
  To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:
  
  Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint
  leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the
  directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc
  cham.  Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce,
  2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices.  Each
  person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the
  nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using
  chopsticks or a fork.
  
  Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.
  
  Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables
  on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a
  cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips
  it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.
  
  NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps
  them crisper than frying in any other oil.

      1    Fresh or dried red chile
           -seeded, finely minced
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Finely grated carrot
 
  Here's scanned recipe number two++another recipe for a perennial
  favorite, Cha gio or Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  I haven't tried this
  one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her
  stuff is usually bang-on.
  
  In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles
  in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes.  Rinse tree
  ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers.  Coarsely chop
  and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch
  lengths; set aside.
  
  Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper.  Add
  tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your
  hands.
  
  Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish
  sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10
  minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated
  carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.
  
  To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow
  pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a
  second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a
  wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens
  to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.
  
  Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact
  log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long.  Place the log
  along the bottom third of the wrapper.  Roll the bottom edge over the
  log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper
  is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to
  enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the
  wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.
  
  Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover
  with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.
  
  To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat
  fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time.  Do not crowd.
  Fry for 10 seconds.  Immediately increase heat to high (375F).
  Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to
  8 minutes.
  
  Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.
  
  Serving suggestions:
  
  Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces .  Dip into sauce and
  enjoy as an appetizer.  Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of
  coriander and mint.  Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part
  of a multi course meal.
  
  NOTE:  If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray
  with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate
  them overnight, wrapped in plastic.  Don't keep them longer than 1
  day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and
  frozen for up to 2 months.  To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet
  and bake at 350F for 10 minutes.
  
  Makes 16 rolls.

           -garnish
      1    Lime or lemon, cut in half

           Crisp fried shrimp chips
           -or:
           Fried rice stick noodles,
           -for garnish
           MARINADE:
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 tb Asian sesame oil
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/8 ts Five-spice powder
           Juice of 1 lemon
 
  * (about 6 x 2 x 1/2-inch piece)
  
  The quality and freshness of the fish is crucial for the success of
  the dish.  Purchase the fish from a Japanese fish shop that
  specializes in sashimi, or a reliable fishmonger.  To facilitate the
  very fine shredding of the radish and carrot, use a mandolin or the
  fine shredding disc of a food processor.
  
  Chill fish until firm.  Cut into paper-thin, 2-inch-long slices
  against the grain; set aside.
  
  In separate bowls, cover radishes and carrots with cold water; set
  aside until ready to assemble salad.  Then rinse and squeeze out
  excess water.
  
  To assemble:  Toss fish slices with marinade ingredients.  Place fish
  in center of a platter.  Arrange daikon and carrot shreds around
  fish. Scatter fresh and pickled ginger, the pickled scallions, lime
  leaves, chiles, green onions and cilantro over fish.  Sprinkle with
  peanuts and sesame seeds.
  
  Just before serving, squeeze the lime or lemon juice over all. It is
  customary for everyone to join in and toss the salad.  Using
  chopsticks, each diner digs from the bottom of the salad and lifts
  the ingredients to mix together.
  
  When the salad is fully tossed, taste for seasoning.  Adjust with more
  sesame oil, lime juice, salt and/or some of the juices from the
  pickled vegetables.
  
  Garnish with shrimp chips or fried rice stick noodles.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Bottled pickled ginger and pickled scallions may be found in
  Chinese markets.  Kaffir lime leaves may be found in Thai grocery
  stores. If kaffir leaves are not available, omit or substitute
  domestic lime leaves.

      Title: RUSTIC HERBED APRICOT CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2    Chickens, cut into 8 pieces
           -each, wing tips trimmed
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      4    Garlic cloves, coarsely
           -chopped
      2 tb Balsamic vinegar
      2 tb Dried thyme
      2 tb Dried tarragon
    1/2 t  Coarsely ground black pepper
      1 lg Onion, halved and thinly
           -sliced
      2 tb All-purpose flour
      2 c  Defatted chicken broth
      1 c  Medium tawny port
      1 tb Red currant jelly
      2 c  Dried apricots
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
           Cooked noodles (opt)
      1 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley,
           -for garnish
 
  Marinating the chicken in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, dried thyme and
  tarragon add great depth to a rice sauce that's smoothed by just a
  hint of red currant jelly and enhanced with apricots and tawny port.
  Be sure to use tawny port. With its beautiful amber color and
  slightly dry flavor, it compliments the apricots. Save your ruby
  port, which is sweeter and has a deep red wine color, for after
  dinner.
  
  1. Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry.
  
  2. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, chopped garlic,
  vinegar, thyme, tarragon and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the chicken,
  toss together well and marinate at room temperature for 2-3 hours or
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  3. Remove chicken from marinade, scraping off any bits that might
  remain. Reserve marinade. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a
  large, heavy casserole. Brown chicken in small batches over medium
  heat until golden, turning once or twice. Set finished pieces aside.
  
  4. Add onion slices to casserole, reduce heat and cook, stirring, for
  2 minutes or until they begin to brown. Toss onion slices with flour
  and continue cooking, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes longer.
  
  5. Add broth, port wine and red currant jelly. Cook, stirring, for
  another 2 minutes. Stir in the apricots, reserved marinade and
  chicken.
  
  6. Cook over low heat, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Remove
  cover and cook for 20-30 minutes more or until chicken is cooked
  through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, serve with
  cooked noodles and garnish with chopped parsley.

      Title: TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Pasta, Casseroles
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 oz Egg noodles
      1 pk Frozen peas (10 oz)
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup (8oz)
      1 c  Milk
      1 cn Tuna,drained (12 1/2 oz)
    1/2 c  Plain or seasoned bread
           -crumbs tossed with
      3 T  Melted butter
           -or
    1/2 c  Crushed Ritz crackers
           -tossed with
      3 T  Melted butter or margarine
 
  Heat the oven to 375'F. with the rack in the center position. Grease
  or spray non-stick vegetable cooking spray on 1 medium to large
  ovenproof baking dish, or two smaller dishes.
  
  Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, but
  shorten the cooking time by 2 minutes. Drain the noodles and combine
  with the peas, soup and milk. Mash the tuna with a fork to break it
  up and add it to the noodles. Mix gently and spoon into prepared pan.
  Sprinkle the crumbs over the top and bake for 35 minutes, until hot.
  
  Variations: Add salt (taste first, as soup may be salted enough);
  freshly grated black pepper; white pepper; snipped fresh herbs, such
  as tarragon, or dried herbs. Also, if you're not an avid fan of bread
  crumbs, 2 cups may be too much. Toss 1/2 to 3/4 cups with 1
  tablespoon melted butter or margarine for a light sprinkling.

      Title: NOODLES WITH SNOW PEA GREENS
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Snow pea greens
      2    Red chilies
        x  Some rice wine (sake,
           Shaohsing, whatever)
    1/2 c  Chopped shallots
     12    Fresh shiitake mushrooms
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 ts Rice vinegar
      4    Chopped scallions
      8    To 12 ounces japanese
           Noodles (soba, udon,
           Whatever -- I used soba)
 
  Lightly steam pea greens -- crisp, but cooked. Chop chilies, shallots and
  scallons.  Slice shiitake thinly.
  
  Heat large non-stick skillet.  Roast chilies for a minute, then add about
  1/4 cup rice wine.  Add shallots and cook till they just start to darken
  (about 4 minutes).  Add more wine if it starts to stick.
  
  (put water on to boil for noodles)
  
  With wine cooked off, add shiitake.  They should give up their own water.
  Cook another 3-5 minutes till mushrooms are fully cooked and pan is drying
  out.  Add soy sauce, vinegar, and scallions.  Cook for a minute and then
  turn off burner and set aside.
  
  Water for noodles should be boiling, add noodles and cook till done, about
  5 minutes usually.
  
  Toss noodles, pea greens and mushrooms.  Eat.
  
  Ya know, slivered shiitake reminds me of tripe when it cooks.  I bet if you
  substituted shiitake for the tripe in a good recipe it would make a tasty
  dish.

      6 lg Egg
    1/4 lb Fontina; grated
    1/4 lb Mozzarella; grated
    1/3 lb Parmesan; grated
      6 T  Butter, sweet; softened
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Pepper, black
      2 T  Basil, fresh; finely chopped
           Parmesan; for sprinkling
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  To make the sauce, gently saute the onion
  and garlic in the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until the
  onion is translucent, about five minutes.  Add the tomato paste and
  stir.  Slowly add the water and stir.  Add the seasonings and allow
  the sauce to simmer while preparing the manicotti and filling.
  
  Manicotti:  Bring a large pot of water to the boil, add the olive
  oil, and drop in the manicotti.  Cook al dente, about 12 minutes.
  Drain and refresh under cold running water.  Set aside.
  
  Filling:  beat the ricotta with the eggs until combined in the large
  bowl of an electric mixer.  Add the grated cheeses and softened
  butter, beat until combined.  Add the salt, pepper and basil.  Beat
  on low just until everything is combined.  Gently fill the cooked
  manicotti with the cheese mixture and arrange in two greased 9"x13"
  pans.  Cover the pasta in each pan with half the sauce; sprinkle on
  additional parmesan.  Bake for about 20 minutes, until the cheese is
  thoroughly melted and the sauce is bubbling.

      Title:  PAN-FRIED NOODLE PILLOW WITH STIR-FRIED CHINESE GREENS
 Categories: Vegetables, Chinese, Masterchefs, Frisco, Cm
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Noodles, egg, 1/16th-inch
           -- thin, Chinese
      2 ts Oil, sesame
      1 ts Salt, kosher
      6 tb Oil, corn OR
      6 tb Oil, peanut
           Seeds, sesame, black
           -- (garnish)

-----------------------------STIR-FRIED GREENS-----------------------------
      1 tb Chives, Chinese
    1/8 c  Garlic, baby, finely
           -- sliced
      6 md Mushrooms, dried, black
  1 1/2 c  Mushrooms, chanterelle,
           -- sliced
  1 1/2 ts Scallion, finely sliced
           -- rings
      3 c  Bok choy, baby, sliced,
           -- with flower-like bases
           -- kept whole
      2 c  Cabbage, Chinese, sliced
      4 sm Chilis, red
      4 sm Chilis, orange
      3 tb Oil, peanut OR
      3 tb Oil, corn
 
       Boil noodles in unsalted water until "al dente." Drain, flush
  with cold water until chilled, then roll loosely in a lint-free towel
  to blot off excess water.
  
       Toss noodles with sesame oil and salt, using your hands to coat
  and separate the strands.
  
       Heat a 12-inch well-seasoned or Silverstone heavy skillet over
  high heat until hot enough to evaporate a bead of water on contact.
  Add 5 tablespoons of oil, swirl to coat the bottom and sides of the
  pan, then reduce heat to medium-high.
  
       When oil is hot enough to sizzle a single noodle, coil the
  noodles in a pan then use a spatula to pack them into an even pancake
  or "pillow." Cover and cook until the bottom is golden, about 5-7
  minutes.
  
       Uncover, flip the noodle pillow over with a jerk of your wrist,
  then cover and cook the second side.  If the pan seems dry, dribble in
  the remaining tablespoon of oil around the side of the skillet before
  covering it.
  
       Slide the noodle pillow out of the pan, cut it into quarters,
  then garnish with a sprinkling of black sesame seeds and vegetables.
  
  Stir-Fried Greens:
  ==================
  
       Soak the dried mushrooms for several hours or overnight in cold
  water.
  
       Drain, rinse, remove any stems, then cut caps into slivers
  1/8-inch wide.
  
       Heat a wok or a large heavy skillet over high heat until hot
  enough to evaporate a bead of water on contact.  Add 2 tablespoons of
  oil, swirl to glaze the pan, then reduce heat to medium-high.
  
       Add the Chinese chive tops, garlic and black mushrooms, toss
  until fully fragrant, then add chanterelles, sliced scallions, and
  cabbage to the pan.  Toss just until vegetables turn supple, about 2
  minutes.
  
       Add baby bok choy, toss until color deepens and the vegetables
  are heated through, about 20 seconds.  If the pan becomes too dry,
  dribble in a bit more oil from the side.
  
       Fold in the chilis, then turn contents out onto a serving plate,
  either alongside or on top of the noodle pillow.
  
       Caution: Chilis are added for color and are not meant to be eaten
  whole!  If a spicier dish is desired, finely sliver a single chili and
  stir-fry it with the shallots before stir-frying the remaining
  vegetables.

 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Onions, chopped
      3    Stalks of celery, chopped
      1    Sweet red pepper, chopped
      6 c  Veggie boullion
      1 t  Turmeric
      1 t  Ground coriander
    1/2 t  Cinnamon
    1/4 t  Cayenne
      1    Potato, chopped
      2    Carrots, chopped
      1 cn (28-oz.) tomatoes, chopped
      1    Zucchini, chopped
      1 c  Coiled vermicelli or Chinese
           Noodles, crumbled
      1 cn Chickpeas, undrained, or 2
        c  Cooked chickpeas
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Italian parsley, chopped
      2 T  Mint leaves, chopped
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Bring onion, celery, red pepper, and 1/2 c. of the boullion to a boil in a
  large pot.  Simmer about 10 minutes to soften the veggies. Add the
  remaining boullion, spices, potato, carrots, and tomatoes; simmer 20
  minutes.  Stir in zucchini, noodles, chickpeas, and lemon juice, and cook 5
  minutes. Garnish with parsley, mint and pepper before serving. 6-8
  servings.
  
  NOTE:  When I made this, I left out the noodles.  I've never had "real"
  harira before so I can't vouch for the authenticity.
  
  The next time I make this, I might leave out the tumeric. It turned the
  chickpeas and the potatoes an unnatural shade of yellow, IMHO.

      Title: SPINACH PASTA WITH RED PEPPERS
 Categories: Digest, Mar95, Archive
      Yield: 5 servings
 
     10    (or more) cloves of garlic,
           Pressed
      3 T  Capers plus a bit of caper
           Liquid (more if you love
           Capers)
      1 T  Basil
      1 t  Rosemary, crushed
      1 c  Water
      1 ea Lemon juice to taste
      3 lg Red peppers, sliced thinly
      1    Box wide spinach noodles (24
           Oz)
 
  Saute garlic, herbs and capers by your favorite saute method.  Add water
  and red peppers, and simmer the red peppers until they are slightly
  softened. A bit of crunch is a good thing. There should be a fair amount of
  liquid left when you are done simmering.
  
  Cook some wide spinach noodles (I used 24oz for five of us) until they are
  just a hair underdone and then drain.  Toss them with the peppers and
  liquid over a low heat until pasta is coated and liquid is absorbed.

      Title: HOT AND SPICY NOODLES WITH VEGETABLES
 Categories: Asian, Favorites, Low-fat, Pasta, Fast food
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4 c  Rice wine
      2 tb Ginger root, grated fresh
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 c  Carrots, thinly sliced
      1 c  Broccoli stems, sliced thin
      1 c  Cabbage, sliced thin
      2    Green onions
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Sesame oil, dark
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 tb Honey (omit if vegan)
      1 ts Hoisin sauce (optional)
      4 c  Rice noodles, cooked
           Soy sauce to taste
 
  In a wok over medium-high heat, heat rice wine or mirin until bubbling. Add
  ginger, garlic, carrots and broccoli.  Stir-fry until carrots soften
  slightly, about five minutes.  Add cabbage and green onions; cover and cook
  three minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove vegetables to a platter and
  set aside.

  desired, to wok and heat until bubbling.  Add noodles and stir-fry until
  heated through.  Add vegetables and heat through.  Add soy sauce to taste.
  Note: The sesame oil gives this dish a great flavor, but leave it out if
  you can't afford the few grams of fat it contributes.

      Title: MY MOTHER'S LETTUCE PACKAGES
 Categories: Entrees, Chinese, Cathe
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Lettuce head
      4 c  Corn oil
    1/3 c  Walnut pieces
      1 oz Bean thread noodles
      1 T  Garlic, minced
     12 oz Pork, ground
      2    Green onions
      1 cn Smoked clams
      1 cn Water chestnuts (small)
      1 c  Lettuce, coarsely chopped
      1 T  Soy sauce
    1/4 t  Cayenne pepper
      2 T  Oyster sauce
      1 t  Sherry
    1/4 t  Sugar
      1 t  Sesame oil
      2 t  Cornstarch, mixed with
      1 T  Water
 
  Cut green onions into pea-sized pieces.  Drain and chop coarsely the smoked
  clams and water chestnuts.  Detach lettuce leaves from core, wash and dry
  them gently.  Arrange lettuce leaves around the edge of a large platter.
  
  Heat oil in wok until it is about to smoke.  Tear bean thread noodles apart
  and cut with scissors into small portions. Carefully put a portion of the
  noodles into the hot oil.  (They will expand dramatically!) As soon as they
  expand, turn them over and cook the other side briefly. Drain them and
  remove to a bowl lined with several layers of paper towels. Cook the
  remaining noodles in the same way.  Drain them very well with paper towels
  and then crunch them and put them into the center of the serving platter,
  surrounded by the lettuce leaves.
  
  Put the walnuts into a strainer and immerse them into the hot oil. They
  will brown very quickly.  Be careful they do not burn. Remove them to a
  paper towel, drain well and chop into coarse pieces.
  
  Remove all but 2 T of oil from the wok.  Saute the minced garlic and
  chopped green onions until lightly browned.  Add the ground pork and saute
  until it loses its pink color and starts to brown. Use a large spoon to
  remove as much grease as possible from the pork mixture.
  
  Add the chopped smoked clams, chopped water chestnuts and chopped lettuce
  to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  Combine the soy sauce, cayenne, oyster sauce, sherry, sugar and sesame oil;
  stir into the cooking mixture and cook for two minutes, stirring
  constantly.  Remix the cornstarch and water and add to the middle of the
  wok.  Stir constantly, blending other ingredients into cornstarch mixture
  and simmer three more minutes.
  
  Pour the cooked dish on top of the bean thread needles on the serving
  platter.  Sprinkle the walnut pieces on top and serve at once. To eat:
  Place a lettuce leaf on your plate.  Put a spoonful of the pork mixture and
  noodles in the middle of the leaf.  Fold the leaf up and eat the package
  like a bared.  Serves 12 as part of a family style Chinese dinner, 4 as a
  main dish.

      Title: MOM'S GREEN NOODLES
 Categories: Pasta, Mom
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Egg noodles
           Parsley
    1/2 c  Butter
           MSG
           Salt, to taste
           Pepper, freshly ground
           Sour cream
           Parmesan cheese, grated
           Romano cheese, grated
           Garlic cloves, pressed
 
  Cook the noodles; reserve.  Melt butter in a large saucepan.  In the
  blender, liquefy "3 to 4 times as much parsley as you'd think you'd need"
  with "the least amount of water possible."  Add to melted butter with
  salt, MSG and "plenty" of black pepper.  Add sour cream until good sauce,
  about a cup; blend.  (Don't heat sour cream too much because it might
  curdle.)  Add grated cheese(s) and pressed garlic, then noodles.

      Title: PEANUT NOODLES
 Categories: Pasta, Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chinese-style noodles,
           -fresh
    1/2 T  Garlic chili paste
      2 T  Peanut butter, good
           -(without added sugar)
      1 T  Nam pla (fermented
           -fish sauce)
    1/2 c  Water
      2    Scallion stalks, chopped
 
  Boil a lot of water for the noodles; this is the most time-consuming step.
  
  Rinse and trim scallions, then slice thinly.  In a small mixing bowl,
  combine peanut butter and chili paste with a fork. Mix thoroughly. Add
  water to the peanut mixture. This is tricky, since peanut butter and water
  do not want to mix. Start with a tiny bit of water, mix thoroughly until it
  is homogeneous, and then add some more water. You can begin to add larger
  quantities of water as the sauce gets thinner. The water and peanut butter
  really will mix, if you are patient.
  
  Continue adding water until the sauce has the consistency you want; I make
  it about the consistency of ketchup. Stir in the nam pla.
  
  Once the pot of water is boiling, cook the noodles until they are just
  done, and not mushy. Drain noodles and immediately mix in the sauce. Toss
  until the noodles are evenly coated. Garnish with scallions and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chinese-style noodles with a spicy peanut sauce -- This recipe is not
  authentic Chinese; it was created by combining readily available
  ingredients and double-checking against a Satay recipe. It's close to a
  Satay sauce, but not quite the same thing. It's also similar to a recipe in
  "The Enchanted Broccoli Forest," by Mollie Katzen.
  
  *  The ingredients are readily available at oriental grocery stores.
  Substitute soy sauce if you can't find nam pla.  For fresh noodles, you can
  substitute several packages of ramen noodles, discarding sauce powders.
  
  *  This basic recipe may be varied by modifying quantities.  Vary the chili
  paste to control hotness, and the nam pla to control saltiness (but the
  sauce will taste saltier before mixing with the noodles). If you use this
  as the main dish of a meal, it serves only two. This will keep for at least
  a week in the refrigerator.
  
  *  Serve with a good beer; it's too spicy for most wines.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes, plus waiting for the water to boil.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: COLD NOODLES IN SPICY PEANUT SAUCE
 Categories: Entrees, Chinese, Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 T  Garlic, minced (fresh)
      3 T  Coriander, minced
           -(fresh)
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
      5 oz Soy sauce, light
      5 T  Sugar
           Rice wine (between
           -1/2 t to 1 T)
      1 T  Hot bean paste
           -(up to 2 T)
      1 T  Sesame oil
      1 lb Lo mein noodles (other
           -noodles will do,
           -such as ramen noodles,
           -or even spaghetti)
 
  Cook the lo mein according to directions.  Let cool.  Mix the rest of the
  ingredients.  Peanut butter doesn't mix very well, so for a few minutes
  you'll think you've made a mistake. Don't worry, just keep stirring until
  it's smooth. Add the sauce to the noodles.
  
  Hot bean sauce also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is the
  main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care.  Vary this
  ingredient to taste. This recipe is probably very good without it. It's
  also quite good served when the noodles are still hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Mildly spicy cold noodles -- I first had this at Brandy Ho's in
  Chinatown, San Francisco. I forget where I found the recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHINESE SPAGHETTI
 Categories: Pasta, Chinese, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Bean sprouts
      2 T  Peas (fresh or frozen)
           -per person
      1    Cucumber
      3    Eggs
    1/2 c  Green onions, chopped
      1 c  Chinese noodles (or
           -linguine) per person
      1 lb Lean pork or beef,
           -chopped into small pieces
      1 t  Ginger, crushed
      1 T  Sesame seed oil
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
      5 T  Sweet bean sauce
           -(or hoisin sauce)
      3 T  Soy sauce
      1 T  Chinese rice wine
  1 1/2 t  Sugar (omit if hoisin
           -sauce was used)
    1/2 t  MSG
      1 T  Green onion, finely
           -chopped
 
  TO PREPARE THE MEAT SAUCE:  Heat about 3 T oil in wok, brown the ginger and
  green onion, then add meat and brown together.
  
  Mix together the bean (or hoisin) and soy sauces, add this mixture to the
  meat, and stir fry briefly.  Then add rice wine, sugar, MSG and sesame oil.
  Add the chicken broth and simmer for about 3 minutes, until the sauce
  becomes thick and shiny. Put mixture in a serving bowl and set aside.
  
  (GARNISHES)
  
  :  o  Boil bean sprouts for 1 minute, drain, and put in serving bowl.
  :  o  Warm peas and put in a serving bowl.
  :  o  Cut cucumber into very fine strips, or grate.  Place in serving bowl.
  :  o  Scramble eggs, fry into very thin pancakes, and cut into thin strips.
  
  TO SERVE:  Cook noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes; drain.  If you are
  preparing this dish ahead, rinse with cold water, drain, and add about 1 T
  sesame seed oil and mix well.
  
  Serve about 1 cup hot or cold noodles in a bowl, then add the garnishes and
  meat sauce to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  The original Chinese spaghetti -- This recipe is an interesting
  variation from the usual restaurant chinese food. When I learned this dish,
  I realized that this was the origin of the Italian pasta dishes. It still
  serves as a reminder that there is a huge variety of Northern Chinese
  dishes that use wheat-based starches instead of rice. Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  This dish can be prepared a day ahead and served cold.  The selection of
  vegetables in the garnish is pretty arbitrary.  All kinds of vegetable
  combinations are good.  The only rule is that they should all be cut into
  thin strips.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  1-2 hours (lots of preparation, little cooking).
  : Precision:  Measure the sauce ingredients.

      Title: HOT SPICY COLD NOODLES
 Categories: Pasta, Picnic, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chinese noodles
           -(fresh)
      4    Scallions (or green
           -onions), chopped
      2 t  Chili oil
      2 t  Sesame seed oil
      2 T  Vinegar
      2 T  Sugar
  1 1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Black pepper
           -(fresh ground)
      1 t  MSG (optional)
      2    Red peppers (fresh),
           -chopped
 
  Cook the noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain.  Rinse them in
  cold water until they are cool, then set aside to drain.
  
  Make the sauce by mixing together all of the other ingredients.  Heat about
  4 T oil in a wok. When it is hot, pour in the sauce mixture, and then the
  noodles.  Stir well to cover the noodles with sauce, then remove and cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy, spicy-hot cold noodles for summer -- This recipe is an easy
  prepare-ahead dish for a hot summer day.  It makes a good barbecue side
  dish for all of us who are tired of potato salads. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  You can serve this dish warm if you want, but it is better when cold. It
  is a good dish to prepare the previous day and leave in the refrigerator
  overnight.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes to prepare, 2 or more hours chilling.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: CAROL'S LASAGNA
 Categories: Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
     10 oz Lasagna noodles
           -(use enough noodles
           -to cover your baking
           -dish 6 layers deep)
      1 t  Salt for each quart
           -of boiling water
      1 lb Mozzarella cheese, grated

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      1 lb Hamburger, lean
      1 md Onion, minced
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 lb Tomatoes, stewed
      1 lb Tomato sauce
      6 oz Tomato paste
    1/4 t  Sugar
      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Basil
      1 t  Parsley

---------------------------------CHEESE MIX---------------------------------
      2    Eggs, beaten
     16 oz Ricotta cheese
      8 oz Cottage cheese,

      1 T  Parsley flakes
      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Oregano
           Pepper to taste
 
  Brown meat and drain off fat.  Heat, but don't brown, onions; stir in
  remaining sauce ingredients.  Simmer for about 30 minutes.
  
  Fill a very large pot with water.  Add about 1 t of salt for each quart of
  water in the pot.  Add the lasagna noodles.  Make sure that you cook enough
  noodles to cover a 13x9 baking pan 6 layers deep.  Pre-heat oven to 350
  degrees F.
  
  Grease the inside of the baking pan with a light vegetable oil.  Now make
  three filling layers.  For each, put down 1/3 of the noodles, in two
  layers. Then spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on the noodles. Then
  sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Finally, top with 1/3 of the
  sauce.  Bake uncovered for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly hot. Let sit for
  5-10 minutes before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hearty lasagna with lots of meat and cheese -- Carol Angell and Juan
  Ochoa are old friends from Tektronix.  Her lasagna recipe is one of my
  favorites.  Yield:  Serves 8-12.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking, 10 minutes cooling.

      Title: AUNT MILDRED'S NOODLE KUGEL
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
      8 oz Noodles, uncooked
      3    Eggs, beaten
      4 oz Cottage cheese
      2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 t  Vanilla extract
     12 oz Pineapple, crushed,
           -with juice
           Cornflake crumbs, to top
 
  Melt butter in a 9x13 pan.  Add noodles.
  
  Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over noodles.
  Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting
  because you don't cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6.
  
  *  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than
  recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first.  It also comes out
  very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as
  many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be
  increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MOM STERN'S NOODLE KUGEL
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      6    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 T  Baking powder
      1 T  Vanilla
      4 oz Raisins (1 small box)
      4    Apples
      1 lb Muller's Wide Egg
           -Noodles (one box)
      4 oz Butter (1 stick)
           Cinnamon (for top)
 
  Peel the apples and and slice them into small wedges.
  
  Beat the eggs until they are foamy, add the sugar gradually and beat well.
  
  Cook the noodles according to package directions.  Drain.
  
  Melt the butter in a 9x13 metal baking pan.  Swirl it around to coat the
  pan, and then pour the excess butter into the egg mixture. Add baking
  powder and vanilla to egg mixture, mix well, and then slowly add drained
  noodles, apples and raisins. Mix thoroughly until all the noodles have been
  coated and look gooey.
  
  Pour the egg/noodle mixture into the metal pan, top with cinnamon if you
  desire, and bake at 425 degrees F. for about 45 minutes to an hour, or
  until the top looks a little brown and crispy. The kugel should feel
  springy to the touch and not be "wet." Let cool, cut into squares and
  serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg noodles, raisins, cinnamon and apples.  Yield:  Serves 12.
  
  *  This feeds about 12 very hungry people (knoshers, as we call them) or 16
  normal ones.  What you don't eat right away you can wrap in aluminum foil
  and freeze for a month or two. If it's too sweet for your taste, you can
  use peaches or other fruit instead of the raisins.
  
  *  Warning:  this stuff sits very heavy in the ol' stomach, so don't try to
  eat more than 2 pieces in a 24-hour period.
  
  *  Don't thank me, thank my mom.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, 1/2 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: BEP'S BARMI GORENG
 Categories: Entrees, Indonesian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Tomatoes, peeled
    1/2 lb Chinese noodles
      1 lb Mince beef
    1/4 lb Middle bacon
      1 T  Tomato paste
      1 md Onion
      2 t  Ketjap benteng manis
           -(sweet soy sauce)
    1/4 t  Sambal oelek
           -(hot pepper condiment)
      4 oz Boemboe nasi
           -goreng (dehydrated
           -vegetables and spices)
    1/4 t  Sambal oedang kering
           -(pepper condiment)
 
  Soak the boemboe nasi goreng in hot water.
  
  Dice and brown the onion, whilst boiling the noodles in another container.
  Add mince and diced bacon to cooked onions and brown.
  
  To soaked the boemboe nasi goreng add tomatoes, sambal oedang kering,
  sambal oelek and ketjak benteng manis; mix well. More spices can be added
  to taste.
  
  Drain the noodles.  Add tomato paste and Chinese noodles to cooked mince.
  Mix together. Bring to even heat and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A tasty Indonesian dish -- This is a recipe that my mother, Bep, has
  perfected.  I have no idea where the recipe originated from but it is a
  great dish that she has perfected over the years. The leftovers are great
  next day, hot or cold. Yield: serves 4.
  
  *  Editor's note:  this recipe is unique in the history of alt.gourmand in
  that virtually none of the ingredients is available in an ordinary North
  American grocery store.  However, with a certain amount of difficulty I was
  able to find all of the ingredients in specialty food stores nearby (though
  admittedly I live in a wonderland of ethnic grocery stores and specialty
  markets.) The recipe is so delicious that it's worth including even though
  most readers will not be able to find the ingredients to make it.
  
  North Americans can read ground beef for mince beef and bacon for middle
  bacon.  You can make an interesting substitute for this dish by using
  Mexican seasonings instead of Indonesian; the flavor will not be at all
  authentic but some of the spirit is preserved.

      1    Onion, minced
      1 c  Meat, boiled (pork,
           -chicken, or shrimp)

  When vegetables are cooked, add rice sticks or noodles and season with salt

  NOTES:
  
  *  Filipino cabbage in garlic and soy sauce -- I got this from Lynne
  Fitzsimmons who got it from a Filipino friend of her mother's.

  leave out the salt and MSG if you like. I have successfully used
  lightly-microwaved bacon as the meat.

  Dumplings:  In a food processor, blend the flour and 1/2 teaspoon
  salt. With the motor running, add the egg yolks and the oil through
  the feed tube, then pour in the water, in a slow, steady stream,
  until the dough forms a ball around the blade.  Transfer the dough to
  a floured surface and knead until smooth, about two minutes.  Cover
  with a linen or cotton (not terry) kitchen towel and let stand half
  an hour.
  
  Divide the dough in half and shape into two balls.  Keep one ball
  covered with the towel.  On a floured surface with a floured rolling
  pin, roll out the dough to a very thin sheet, about 1/16" thick,
  making sure it doesn't tear.  With a round cookie cutter, cut out
  circles about 3" in diameter. Gather the scraps together into a ball
  and set aside, covered.
  
  Have a bowl with the egg white by you.  Place a heaping teaspoon of
  the desired filling in the middle of each circle.  Fold the dough
  over the filling to form a semi-circle.  Brush the edges with the egg
  white and press the edges firmly together with the tines of a fork to
  seal.  Place the vareniki as they are made on a lightly floured large
  baking sheet about 1" apart and keep covered with a damp tea towel.
  When finished with the first batch, roll out the second ball of dough
  and make a second batch.  Add the leftover scraps of dough to the
  scraps left from the first batch, knead into a ball, and roll out for
  a final batch of varenyky.
  
  Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil.
  Reduce the heat to medium so the water simmers and carefully lower
  half the varenyky into the water.  Boil, stirring occasionally with a
  wooden spoon to prevent sticking, until they rise to the surface and
  are cooked through, six to seven minutes.  With a slotted spoon,
  carefully remove the varenyky to a colander and drain thoroughly.
  Transfer to a deep serving bowl and toss with half the butter.
  Repeat for the second half of the varenyky.
  
  Potato filling:  Melt the butter in a small skilled over medium heat.
  Add the onion and saut#, stirring occasionally, until nicely browned,
  about 15 minutes.  Remvoe from heat and cool slightly.  In a large
  bowl, combine the potatoes and cheese.  Add the saut#ed onion along
  with the melted butter and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper and
  use for filling the varenyky.
  
  Sauerkraut filling:  Saut# the bacon in a large skillet over medium
  heat until it renders its fat.  Remove the bacon and reserve.  Drain
  off all but two tablespoons fat.  Add the onion to the skillet and
  saut#, stirring frequentlly over medium heat until nicely browned,
  almost 15 minutes. Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the kraut,
  and saut#, stirring, until softened and cooked throughout, 10 to 15
  minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste, sugar, and broth.  Reduce the
  heat to low, then cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove from the
  heat and cool to room temperature before using to fill the varenyky.
  Use the reserved bacon as topping.
