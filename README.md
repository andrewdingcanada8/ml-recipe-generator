# ml-recipe-generator

This repository is home to salad party's recipe generator model! For the term 
project for our Brown Deep Learning course, we've decided to create an LSTM 
based deep learning model that generates novel recipes given any starting str.

It is trained on the meal-masters dataset and ... [WIP]

## Setup
```bash
# run ./create_venv.sh to setup the python venv
./create_venv

# activate the venv
source env/bin/activate
```
## Dataset
We've already downloaded, parsed, tokenized and pickled our meal-master data via
the included jupyter notebook. If you want to see how we did it you can re-run
the included `data.ipynb`

## Running the Model
